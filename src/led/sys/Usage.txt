LEDs.o

   Usage:
   ====================================================
   insmod LEDs.o [PowerLED=X]  [ConnectedLED=Y] [RegID=Z]
   where X and Y are:
      0: Turn off the LED.
         This is assumed if that LED parameter is not present.
      1: Turn on the LED
     -1: Disable the LED GPIO output.

   Z is 0~4, the GPIO Register to use for LED control. Default is 0.
     This shall be issued if the LEDs are not working properly.
     It happens when multiple programs are accessing the GPIOs
     by the *same* register. To solve the above problem, you
     need to *guess* which one is not used by looking at the LED
     behaviors.
     Once you have chosen, e.g. 2, You shall always use RegID=2
     for LED control.

   Example:
   ===========================================
   Turn on Both LEDs:
      insmod ./LEDs.o PowerLED=1 ConnectedLED=1
      rmmod LEDs
   Turn on PowerLED, turn off ConnectedLED:
      insmod ./LEDs.o PowerLED=1 ConnectedLED=0
      (or equivalently: insmod ./LEDs.o PowerLED=1)
      rmmod LEDs
   Turn off PowerLED, turn on ConnectedLED:
      insmod ./LEDs.o PowerLED=0 ConnectedLED=1
      (or equivalently: insmod ./LEDs.o ConnectedLED=1)
      rmmod LEDs
   Turn off Both LEDs
      insmod ./LEDs.o PowerLED=0 ConnectedLED=0
      (or equivalently: insmod ./LEDs.o)
      rmmod LEDs
   Disable the LED GPIO output:
      insmod ./LEDs.o PowerLED=-1 ConnectedLED=-1
      rmmod LEDs

   Note
   ================================================
   rmmod LEDs must be executed before next insmod.
