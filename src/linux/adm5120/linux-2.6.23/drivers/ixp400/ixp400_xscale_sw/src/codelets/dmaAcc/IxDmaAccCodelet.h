 *
 * @brief Intel (R) IXP400 Software DMA Access component API
 *
 * This file contains a main interface of the Dma Access Codelet that 
 * initialises the DmaAcc codelet and execute Dma transfer using 
 * ixDmaAccCodeletTestPerform() function for various DMA transfer mode, 
 * addressing mode and transfer width. The block size used in this codelet
 * are 8,1024,16384,32768,65528 bytes. For each Dma configuration, the 
 * performance will be measured and the average rate (in Mbps) will be
 * displayed
 *
 * <b> VxWorks* User Guide </b><br>
 *  <pre>
 *  <i> Usage :
 *      -> ixDmaAccCodeletMain()
 *
 * Note:
 * 1. Once the function is executed, the codelet will display the results <br>
 * 2. The formulae to calculate the rate is: <br>
 *    Rate (in Mbps)  = ( (length * 8) / (ticks / 66) ) 
 *

 *
 * <b> Linux* User Guide </b><br>

 * <i>  Usage :

 *
 * Note: <br>
 * 1. Once the function is executed, the codelet will display the results <br>

 *
 * <b> DmaAcc Codelet Features </b>
 *
 * The API ixDmaAccCodeletTestPerform() allows the user to perform a
 * Dma transfer of block size 0 to 65535 bytes between two locations
 * in the SRAM. The user can specify any combination of the following modes.   
 *
 *            DMA Transfer Modes 
 *	         1. Copy
 *	      	 2. Copy and Clear Source
 *	      	 3. Copy with Bytes Swap
 *	      	 4. Copy with Bytes Reversed
 *
 *	      DMA Addressing Modes
 *	      	 1. Incremental Source to Incremental Destination Addressess
 *	         2. Fixed Source to Incremental Destination Addressess
 *	      	 3. Incremental Source to Fixed Destination Addressess
 *
 *	      DMA Transfer Widths
 *	       	 1. 32-bit Transfer
 *	      	 2. 16-bit Transfer
 *	      	 3. 8-bit Transfer
 *	      	 4. Burst Transfer
 *
 *  NOTE : The user must initialise the system with ixDmaAccCodeletInit prior to 
 *         calling the function ixDmaAccCodeletiTestPerform()
 *
 * Performance will execute PERFORMANCE_NUM_LOOP (i.e. 100 runs) in order to 
 * calculate the average rate for each Dma transfer configuration
