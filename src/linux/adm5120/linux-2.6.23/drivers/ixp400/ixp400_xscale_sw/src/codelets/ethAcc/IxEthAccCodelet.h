 *
 * @brief Intel (R) IXP400 Software Ethernet Access Codelet API
 *
 * This codelet demonstrates both Ethernet Data and Control plane services and 
 * Ethernet Management services. 
 * <UL>
 *   <LI> A) Ethernet Data and Control plane services: 
 *   <UL>
 *        <LI> Configuring both ports as a receiver sink from an external source (such 
 *            as Smartbits).
 *        <LI> Configuring Port-1 to automatically transmit frames and receive frames on Port-2. 
 *             Frames generated and transmitted in Port-1 are loopbacked into Port-2 by using cross cable.
 *        <LI> Configuring and performing a software loopback on each of the two ethernet ports.
 *	  <LI> Configuring both ports to act as a bridge so that frames received on one port are retransmitted on the other.
 *   </UL>
 * </UL>
 *
 *   <UL>
 *   <LI> B) Ethernet Management services: 
 *      <UL>
 *	<LI> Adding and removing static/dynamic entries.
 *	<LI> Calling the maintenance interface (shall be run as a separate background task)
 *      <LI> Calling the show routine to display the MAC address filtering tables.    
 *      </UL>
 *   </UL>
 *
 * <b> Definition </b><br>
 * In the context of this codelet, the following definitions are applicable.<br>
 * Port 1 = ixe0 = Ethernet port associated with NPE-B Ethernet Coprocessor.<br> 
 * Port 2 = ixe1 = Ethernet port associated with NPE-C Ethernet Coprocessor.<br>    
 * Port 3 = ixe2 = Ethernet port associated with NPE-A Ethernet Coprocessor.<br>    
 *
 * <b> Design constraints </b><br>
 * This codelet assumes that the underlying Intel(R) IXP4XX Product Line of Network Processors
 * have two Ethernet NPEs. For silicon with single Ethernet NPE, operation will be only 
 * functional in the particular Ethernet port that corresponds to the available Ethernet NPE.
 * Particularly, bridge operation will not work as two Ethernet ports are needed in this operation. 
 *
 * <b> Assumptions </b><br>
 * This codelet illustrates the use EthAcc APIs. The operations provided may not be
 * working on the best performance as the target of this codelet is just to show the 
 * functionality of APIs. In order to get better performance, #undef
 * IX_ETHACC_CODELET_TXGENRXSINK_VERIFY to disable traffic verification. <br>
 *
 * Please note that this codelet is not optimized for production quality.
 *   
 * For performance testing, please use the operations below:
 * <UL>
 * <LI> Rx Sink Operation.
 * <LI> TxGenRxSink Operation.
 * <LI> Bridge Operation with Ethernet frames sent into either one of the Ethernet Ports.
 * </UL>
 * 
 * The operations below need special tuning to optimize them. Tuning can be done by either 
 * using a lower traffic(frames/second), reducing the value of  IX_ETHACC_CODELET_TXGEN_PCKS
 * or  #undef IX_ETHACC_CODELET_TXGENRXSINK_VERIFY.
 * <UL>  
 *  <LI> Software Loopback Operation.
 *  <LI> PHY Loopback Operation.
 *  <LI> Bridge Operation with Ethernet frames sent into both Ethernet Ports.
 * </UL>
 *
 * <b> VxWorks* User Guide </b><br>
 * ixEthAccCodeletMain() function is used as a single point of execution for 
 * EthAcc Codelet. It allows user to enter selection for different type 
 * of supported operations described below:
