 * @brief This function takes the client specified parameters, configures

 *
 * @param IxHssAccHssPort hssPortId (in) - The HSS port Id. There are two identical ports (0-1).
 * @param unsigned bytesPerTSTrigger (in) - The NPE will trigger the access
 * component after bytesPerTSTrigger have been received for all trunk
 * timeslots. This figure must be a multiple of 8 e.g. 8 for 1ms trigger,
 * 16 for 2ms trigger.
 * @param UINT8 *rxCircular (in) - A pointer to memory allocated by the
 * client to be filled by data received. The buffer at this address is part
 * of a pool of buffers to be accessed in a circular fashion.
 * @param unsigned numRxBytesPerTS (in) - The number of bytes allocated per
 * timeslot within the receive memory. This figure will depend on the
 * latency of the system. It needs to be deep enough for data to be read by
 * the client before the NPE re-writes over that memory e.g. if the client
 * samples at a rate of 40bytes per timeslot, numRxBytesPerTS may need to
 * be 40bytes * 3. This would give the client 3 * 5ms of time before
 * received data is over-written.
 * @param UINT32 *txPtrList (in) - The address of an area of contiguous
 * memory allocated by the client to be populated with pointers to data for
 * transmission. Each pointer list contains a pointer per active channel
 * @param unsigned numTxPtrLists (in) - The number of pointer lists in
 * txPtrList. This figure is dependent on jitter.
 * @param unsigned numTxBytesPerBlk (in) - The size of the Tx data, in
 * bytes, that each pointer within the txPtrList points to.
 * @param IxHssAccChanRxCallback rxCallback (in) - A client function
 * pointer to be called back to handle the actual tx/rx of channelised
 * data. If this is not NULL, an ISR will call this function. If this
 * pointer is NULL, it implies that the client will use a polling mechanism
 * to detect when the tx/rx of channelised data is to occur. The client
 * will use hssChanAccStatus for this.
