* OCTEON SD/MMC Host Controller

This controller is present on some members of the Cavium OCTEON SoC
family, provide an interface for eMMC, MMC and SD devices.  There is a
single controller that may have several "slots" connected.  These
slots appear as children of the main controller node.
The DMA engine is an integral part of the controller block.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc" or "cavium,octeon-7890-mmc"
- reg : Two entries:
	1) The base address of the MMC controller register bank.
	2) The base address of the MMC DMA engine register bank.
- interrupts :
	For "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc": two entries:
	1) The MMC controller interrupt line.
	2) The MMC DMA engine interrupt line.
	For "cavium,octeon-7890-mmc": nine entries:
	1) The next block transfer of a multiblock transfer has completed (BUF_DONE)
	2) Operation completed successfully (CMD_DONE).
	3) DMA transfer completed successfully (DMA_DONE).
	4) Operation encountered an error (CMD_ERR).
	5) DMA transfer encountered an error (DMA_ERR).
	6) Switch operation completed successfully (SWITCH_DONE).
	7) Switch operation encountered an error (SWITCH_ERR).
	8) Internal DMA engine request completion interrupt (DONE).
	9) Internal DMA FIFO underflow (FIFO).
- #address-cells : Must be <1>
- #size-cells : Must be <0>

Required properties of child nodes:
- compatible : Should be "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc-slot".
- reg : The slot number.

Optional properties of child nodes:
- cd-gpios : Specify GPIOs for card detection
- wp-gpios : Specify GPIOs for write protection
- power-gpios : Specify GPIOs for power control
- cavium,bus-max-width : The number of data lines present in the slot.
	Default is 8.
- spi-max-frequency : The maximum operating frequency of the slot.
	Default is 52000000.
- cavium,cmd-clk-skew : the amount of delay (in pS) past the clock edge
	to sample the command pin.
- cavium,dat-clk-skew : the amount of delay (in pS) past the clock edge
	to sample the data pin.

Example:
	mmc@1180000002000 {
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc";
		reg = <0x11800 0x00002000 0x0 0x100>,
		      <0x11800 0x00000168 0x0 0x20>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		/* EMM irq, DMA irq */
		interrupts = <1 19>, <0 63>;

		/* The board only has a single MMC slot */
		mmc-slot@0 {
			compatible = "cavium,octeon-6130-mmc-slot";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <20000000>;
			/* bus width can be 1, 4 or 8 */
			cavium,bus-max-width = <8>;
			cd-gpios = <&gpio 9 0>;
			wp-gpios = <&gpio 10 0>;
			power-gpios = <&gpio 8 0>;
		};
	};
