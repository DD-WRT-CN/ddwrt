Gateworks System Controller multi-function device

The GSC is a Multifunction I2C slave device with the following submodules:
- WDT
- GPIO
- Pushbutton controller
- HWMON

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "gw,gsc_v1", "gw,gsc_v2", "gw,gsc_v3"
- reg: I2C address of the device
- interrupts: interrupt triggered by GSC_IRQ# signal
- interrupt-parent: Interrupt controller GSC is connected to
- #interrupt-cells: should be <1>, index of the interrupt within the
  controller, in accordance with the "one cell" variant of
  <devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupt.txt>

Optional nodes:
* watchdog:
The GSC provides a Watchdog monitor which can power cycle the board's
primary power supply on most board models when tripped.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "gw,gsc-watchdog"

* input:
The GSC provides an input device capable of dispatching Linux Input events
for user pushbutton events, tamper switch events, etc.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "gw,gsc-input"

* hwmon:
The GSC provides a set of Analog to Digitcal Converter (ADC) pins used for
temperature and/or voltage monitoring.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "gw,gsc-hwmon"

Example:

	gsc@20 {
		compatible = "gw,gsc_v3";
		reg = <0x20>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts <4 2>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;

		watchdog {
			compatible = "gw,gsc-watchdog";
		};

		hwmon {
			compatible = "gw,gsc-hwmon";

			vin: adc1 {
				label = "vin";
				min-microvolt = <725000>;
				max-microvolt = <2075000>;
			}

			adc-channel@c {
				reg = <0x00 0x0c>;
			}

			hwmon@1 {
			};
		};
