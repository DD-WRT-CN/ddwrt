 *
 * @brief Intel (R) IXP400 Software HSS Access Codelet API. The interface for the HSS Access Codelet.
 *
 * This module contains the implementation of the HSS Access Codelet.
 * <P>
 * The following top-level operation is supported:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Test Packetised and Channelised Services, with the Codelet acting
 *       as data source/sink and HSS as loopback.
 *   The Codelet will transmit data and verify that data received is the
 * same as that transmitted. Codelet runs for IX_HSS_CODELET_DURATION_IN_MS ms. 
 *   <LI>There are four clients of Packetised service per HSS port - 1 client
 *	 per E1/T1 trunk. Client 0 and 2 are running in Packetised HDLC mode while 
 *	 client 1 and 3 in Packetised RAW mode.
 * </UL>
 *
 * <b> Assumptions </b><br>
 * In Channelised service, the codelet transmits traffic continuously. When
 * the codelet runs up to IX_HSS_CODELET_DURATION_IN_MS ms, Tx counter is bigger 
 * than Rx counter. This is due to the fact that traffics submitted to NPE (i.e. 
 * Tx counter has been increased) are not transmitted out by NPE when HSS service
 * is disabled. These traffics will be dropped and not loopbacked at HSS (Hence, 
 * Rx counter not increased).<br>
 *
 * In Packetised-raw mode service (client 1 and 3), Rx counter will be bigger than 
 * Tx counter because in this service, idle packets are received by Intel XScale(R)
 * Core and causes Rx counter to be bigger than Tx counter. As for packetised-HDLC
 * service, idle packets are handled in HDLC coprocessor and not passed to Intel 
 * XScale(R) Core (Hence, Rx counter not increased).     
 *
 * <b> Limitations </b><br>
 * When executing Packetised service on both HSS ports of 266MHz Intel (R) IXP42X
 * Processor simultaneously, receive traffic verification should fail on client 3 (i.e. 
 * Packetised-raw mode) of HSS port 1. The reason why this issue occured is IXP421
 * processor does not have enough CPU resources to perform intensive packet verification 
 * tasks. However, this does not imply that the same issue will hit customer 
 * applications because actual applications will not do any packet verifications 
 * in the way that the codelet does. This issue is not seen on a 533MHz Intel (R) 
 * IXP42X processor.

 *      Where c:
 *           1 = codelet verifies traffic received in hardware loopback mode.
 *           2 = codelet does not verify traffic received in hardware loopback mode.

 * </pre>
 * <P>
 * <B>Buffer Management</B>
 * <P>
 * The packetised service uses mbuf buffers to store data, and chains mbufs
 * together to form large packets.  In the transmit direction, mbufs are
 * allocated from a pool on transmit, and returned to the pool on tranmsit
 * done.  For receive, mbufs are allocated from a pool when supplying
 * buffers to the free queue, and returned to the pool on receive.
 * <P>
 * The channelised service operates quite differently.  As voice data is
 * very sensitive to latency using mbufs for transferral of the data
 * between Intel XScale(R) Core and NPE is not very appropriate.  Instead,
 * circular buffers are used whereby the NPE reads data from a block of SDRAM
 * that the Intel XScale(R) Core writes to, and writes data to a block of 
 * SDRAM that Intel XScale(R) Core reads from.  On receive, the NPE writes 
 * directly into a circular buffer that Intel XScale(R) Core subsequently 
 * reads the data from. Each channel has its own circular buffer, and all 
 * these buffers are stored contiguously. On transmit, the NPE takes a 
 * circular list of pointers from Intel XScale(R) Core and transmits the data 
 * referenced by these pointers. Each list of pointers contains a pointer for
 * each channel, and the circular list of pointers contains multiple lists 
 * stored contiguously. This is to allow Intel XScale(R) Core to transmit voice 
 * samples without having to copy data, as only the pointer to the data blocks
 * needs to be written to SDRAM.  The NPE lets Intel XScale(R) Core know, in 
 * the form of Tx and Rx offsets, where in the blocks of SDRAM it is currently 
 * reading from and writing to. This enables Intel XScale(R) Core to co-ordinate 
 * its reading and writing activities to maintain the data flow. The Tx offset 
 * lets Intel XScale(R) Core know the list offset into the Tx circular pointer 
 * list that the NPE will next use to transmit. The Rx offset lets Intel 
 * XScale(R) Core know the byte offset into each channel's Rx circular buffer 
 * that the NPE will next receive data into.
 * <P>
 * <B>Caching</B>
 * <P>
 * To improve system performance, caching may be enabled for both the
 * channelised and packetised buffers.  To allow for this, buffers need to
 * be flushed before transmit, and invalidated after receive.  Flushing the
 * buffers before transmit ensures the NPE reads and transmits the correct
 * data.  Invalidating the buffers after receive ensures Intel XScale(R) Core
 * reads and processes the correct data.  In the case of the Codelet, all data
 * is flushed and invalidated as every byte is being written to on transmit
 * and every byte is verified on receive.  In a real application flushing
 * or invalidating all the data may not be necessary, only the data that
 * the application has written before transmit or will read after receive.
 * Note, regarding the packetised service, the IxHssAcc component itself
 * takes care of flushing and invalidating mbuf headers.  The application
 * needs only to concern itself with the mbuf data.
 * <P>
 * <B>Data Verification Strategy</B>
 * <P>
 * For both the packetised and channelised service a changing pattern will
 * be transmitted.  When the HSS co-processor is performing a loopback the
 * data received is expected to be the same as that transmitted.  The data
 * transmitted carries a byte pattern that begins at a known value and is
 * incremented for each byte.  An independent byte pattern is transmitted
 * for each channel of the channelised service, and also for each port of
 * the packetised service.  When data is received it is expected to match
 * the pattern that was transmitted.  For the channelised service the first
 * non-idle byte received is expected to be the beginning of the byte
 * pattern.  For the packetised service, RAW mode clients may receive idle
 * data so this is detected and ignored.  Only non-idle data is verified.
 * <P>
 * <B>56Kbps Packetised HDLC feature</B>
 * <P>
 * This feature is demonstrated in one of the packetised HDLC clients (i.e. 
 * client 2). The CAS bit is configured to be in the least signicant bit 
 * (LSB) position with bit polarity '1'. Bit inversion is also enabled on 
 * this client as well. The data verification strategy remains the same as
 * other packetised clients.
