Overview of changes in libmbim 1.14
----------------------------------------

* New support for the 'QMI over MBIM' service, so that clients can use libqmi to
  build messages and libmbim to transport them.

* The GUDev library, which we use to read the max message size from the USB
  descriptor, is now optional. When configuring, it will be used by default only
  if it's found. It can also be explicitly disabled using the new configure
  switch '--without-udev' or explicitly enabled using '--with-udev'. If GUDev
  isn't used, libmbim-glib will rely on sysfs directly.

* libmbim-glib updates:
  ** Added support for building messages of custom services.

* mbim-network updates:
  ** Added support for loading profiles from different paths using the new
     '--profile' option. This makes it possible to use mbim-network with
     multiple devices running in the same system.
  ** Added support to allow specifying APN user (APN_USER), password (APN_PASS)
     and authentication type (APN_AUTH) in the profile.
  ** Added support to allow using the mbim-proxy setup by configuring it in
     the profile file (PROXY=yes).

* Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.12.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.14.0:

 * mbimcli updates:
   ** Updated '--connect' arguments to allow specifying "key=value" pairs. The
      old legacy "[(APN),(PAP|CHAP|MSCHAPV2),(Username),(Password)]" format is
      kept as valid for backwards compatibility, although it should be assumed
      deprecated.
   ** Longer timeouts for connect/register operations.
   ** Report IP configuration when connected.
   ** Allow specifying session ids.

 * libmbim-glib updates:
   ** Probing retry interval increased to 5s.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.12
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-mbim-username' option during configure, which allows specifying
  which will be the user owning the /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all MBIM
  modems (udev rules are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
  used, the mbim-proxy will only allow connections from processes running by the
  specified user or by the root user.

* Function error messages can now be returned by the MbimDevice as responses to
  `Command', `Open' or `Close' messages. Users of the library should not assume
  the type of message returned to the previous actions.

* The MbimProxy will monitor for 'NotOpened' errors, and when one detected it
  will directly close the internal MbimDevice. Any subsequent request sent by
  clients to that specific device will be aborted with a proxy-generated
  'NotOpened' error. Clients will need to explicitly reopen the ports in that
  case.

* The API now has a new mbim_message_response_get_result() method which allows
  getting a GError from a message which may be of a specific type (e.g. a
  `Command Done' message in response to a `Command' request) or instead the
  generic `Function Error' message type. Users of the library can use this new
  method to avoid assuming the type of message returned.

      E.g. the following check:
          mbim_message_command_done_get_result (response, &error);
      Can be updated as:
          mbim_message_response_get_result (response,
                                            MBIM_MESSAGE_TYPE_COMMAND_DONE,
                                            &error);
      And the same logic can be applied to `Open' and `Close' messages.

* Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
  ** Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
  ** Fix bashisms in the mbim-network script.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.10
----------------------------------------

 * API break: Flag values in 'MbimRegistrationFlag' were updated to match the
   ones in the MBIM documentation.

 * Implemented a new 'mbim-proxy', which allows sharing a single MBIM control
   port among different processes. The usage of the proxy is optional, and can
   be requested by specifying the MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_PROXY flag in the new
   mbim_device_open_full() method. The 'mbimcli' command line tool was also
   extended with a new '--device-open-proxy,-p' option, to allow requesting the
   use of the proxy process.

 * New 'removed' signal added to the MbimDevice, to notify when the underlying
   connection to the device is lost (e.g. lost connection to the mbim-proxy, or
   lost access to the MBIM control port).

 * Added support for registering and using custom services.

 * Added additional GMM cause codes to MbimNwError.

 * Transactions are now matched not only by ID but also by type.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.
