\fBchrony.conf\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This file configures the \fBchronyd\fP daemon. The compiled\-in location is
\fI@SYSCONFDIR@/chrony.conf\fP, but other locations can be specified on the
\fBchronyd\fP command line with the \fB\-f\fP option.
.sp
Each directive in the configuration file is placed on a separate line. The
following sections describe each of the directives in turn. The directives can
occur in any order in the file and they are not case\-sensitive.
.sp
The configuration directives can also be specified directly on the \fBchronyd\fP
command line. In this case each argument is parsed as a new line and the
configuration file is ignored.
.sp
While the number of supported directives is large, only a few of them are
typically needed. See the \fBEXAMPLES\fP section for configuration in
typical operating scenarios.
.sp
The configuration file might contain comment lines. A comment line is any line
that starts with zero or more spaces followed by any one of the following
characters: \fB!\fP, \fB;\fP, \fB#\fP, \fB%\fP. Any line with this format will be ignored.
.SH "DIRECTIVES"
.SS "Time sources"
.sp
\fBserver\fP \fIhostname\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The \fBserver\fP directive specifies an NTP server which can be used as a time
source. The client\-server relationship is strictly hierarchical: a client might
synchronise its system time to that of the server, but the server\(cqs system time
will never be influenced by that of a client.
.sp
The \fBserver\fP directive is immediately followed by either the name of the
server, or its IP address. The \fBserver\fP directive supports the following
options:
.sp
\fBminpoll\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the minimum interval between requests sent to the server
as a power of 2 in seconds. For example, \fBminpoll 5\fP would mean that the
polling interval should not drop below 32 seconds. The default is 6 (64
seconds), the minimum is \-6 (1/64th of a second), and the maximum is 24 (6
months). Note that intervals shorter than 6 (64 seconds) should generally not
be used with public servers on the Internet, because it might be considered
abuse. A sub\-second interval will be enabled only when the server is reachable
and the round\-trip delay is shorter than 10 milliseconds, i.e. the server
should be in a local network.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxpoll\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the maximum interval between requests sent to the server
as a power of 2 in seconds. For example, \fBmaxpoll 9\fP indicates that the polling
interval should stay at or below 9 (512 seconds). The default is 10 (1024
seconds), the minimum is \-6 (1/64th of a second), and the maximum is 24 (6
months).
.RE
.sp
\fBiburst\fP
.RS 4
With this option, the interval between the first four requests sent to the
server will be 2 seconds or less instead of the interval specified by the
\fBminpoll\fP option, which allows \fBchronyd\fP to make the first update of the clock
shortly after start.
.RE
.sp
\fBburst\fP
.RS 4
With this option, \fBchronyd\fP will shorten the interval between up to four
requests to 2 seconds or less when it cannot get a good measurement from the
server. The number of requests in the burst is limited by the current polling
interval to keep the average interval at or above the minimum interval, i.e.
the current interval needs to be at least two times longer than the minimum
interval in order to allow a burst with two requests.
.RE
.sp
\fBkey\fP \fIID\fP
.RS 4
The NTP protocol supports a message authentication code (MAC) to prevent
computers having their system time upset by rogue packets being sent to them.
The MAC is generated as a function of a password specified in the key file,
which is specified by the \fBkeyfile\fP directive.
.sp
The \fBkey\fP option specifies which key (with an ID in the range 1 through 2^32\-1)
should \fBchronyd\fP use to authenticate requests sent to the server and verify its
responses. The server must have the same key for this number configured,
otherwise no relationship between the computers will be possible.
.sp
If the server is running \fBntpd\fP and the output size of the hash function used
by the key is longer than 160 bits (e.g. SHA256), the \fBversion\fP option needs to
be set to 4 for compatibility.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxdelay\fP \fIdelay\fP
.RS 4
\fBchronyd\fP uses the network round\-trip delay to the server to determine how
accurate a particular measurement is likely to be. Long round\-trip delays
indicate that the request, or the response, or both were delayed. If only one
of the messages was delayed the measurement error is likely to be substantial.
.sp
For small variations in the round\-trip delay, \fBchronyd\fP uses a weighting scheme
when processing the measurements. However, beyond a certain level of delay the
measurements are likely to be so corrupted as to be useless. (This is
particularly so on dial\-up or other slow links, where a long delay probably
indicates a highly asymmetric delay caused by the response waiting behind a lot
of packets related to a download of some sort).
.sp
If the user knows that round trip delays above a certain level should cause the
measurement to be ignored, this level can be defined with the \fBmaxdelay\fP
option. For example, \fBmaxdelay 0.3\fP would indicate that measurements with a
round\-trip delay of 0.3 seconds or more should be ignored. The default value is
3 seconds and the maximum value is 1000 seconds.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxdelayratio\fP \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
This option is similar to the \fBmaxdelay\fP option above. \fBchronyd\fP keeps a record
of the minimum round\-trip delay amongst the previous measurements that it has
buffered. If a measurement has a round trip delay that is greater than the
maxdelayratio times the minimum delay, it will be rejected.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxdelaydevratio\fP \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
If a measurement has a ratio of the increase in the round\-trip delay from the
minimum delay amongst the previous measurements to the standard deviation of
the previous measurements that is greater than the specified ratio, it will be
rejected. The default is 10.0.
.RE
.sp
\fBmindelay\fP \fIdelay\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies a fixed minimum round\-trip delay to be used instead of
the minimum amongst the previous measurements. This can be useful in networks
with static configuration to improve the stability of corrections for
asymmetric jitter, weighting of the measurements, and the \fBmaxdelayratio\fP and
\fBmaxdelaydevratio\fP tests. The value should be set accurately in order to have a
positive effect on the synchronisation.
.RE
.sp
\fBasymmetry\fP \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the asymmetry of the network jitter on the path to the
source, which is used to correct the measured offset according to the delay.
The asymmetry can be between \-0.5 and +0.5. A negative value means the delay of
packets sent to the source is more variable than the delay of packets sent from
the source back. By default, \fBchronyd\fP estimates the asymmetry automatically.
.RE
.sp
\fBoffset\fP \fIoffset\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies a correction (in seconds) which will be applied to
offsets measured with this source. It\(cqs particularly useful to compensate for a
known asymmetry in network delay or timestamping errors. For example, if
packets sent to the source were on average delayed by 100 microseconds more
than packets sent from the source back, the correction would be \-0.00005 (\-50
microseconds). The default is 0.0.
.RE
.sp
\fBminsamples\fP \fIsamples\fP
.RS 4
Set the minimum number of samples kept for this source. This overrides the
\fBminsamples\fP directive.
.RE
.sp
\fBmaxsamples\fP \fIsamples\fP
.RS 4
Set the maximum number of samples kept for this source. This overrides the
\fBmaxsamples\fP directive.
.RE
.sp
\fBfilter\fP \fIsamples\fP
.RS 4
This option enables a median filter to reduce noise in NTP measurements. The
filter will reduce the specified number of samples to a single sample. It is
intended to be used with very short polling intervals in local networks where
it is acceptable to generate a lot of NTP traffic.
.RE
.sp
\fBoffline\fP
.RS 4
If the server will not be reachable when \fBchronyd\fP is started, the \fBoffline\fP
option can be specified. \fBchronyd\fP will not try to poll the server until it is
enabled to do so (by using the \fBonline\fP command in
\fBchronyc\fP).
.RE
.sp
\fBauto_offline\fP
.RS 4
With this option, the server will be assumed to have gone offline when sending
a request fails, e.g. due to a missing route to the network. This option avoids
the need to run the \fBoffline\fP command from \fBchronyc\fP
when disconnecting the network link. (It will still be necessary to use the
\fBonline\fP command when the link has been established, to
enable measurements to start.)
.RE
.sp
\fBprefer\fP
.RS 4
Prefer this source over sources without the \fBprefer\fP option.
.RE
.sp
\fBnoselect\fP
.RS 4
Never select this source. This is particularly useful for monitoring.
.RE
.sp
\fBtrust\fP
.RS 4
Assume time from this source is always true. It can be rejected as a
falseticker in the source selection only if another source with this option
does not agree with it.
.RE
.sp
\fBrequire\fP
.RS 4
Require that at least one of the sources specified with this option is
selectable (i.e. recently reachable and not a falseticker) before updating the
clock. Together with the \fBtrust\fP option this might be useful to allow a trusted
authenticated source to be safely combined with unauthenticated sources in
order to improve the accuracy of the clock. They can be selected and used for
synchronisation only if they agree with the trusted and required source.
.RE
.sp
\fBxleave\fP
.RS 4
This option enables an interleaved mode which allows the server or the peer to
send transmit timestamps captured after the actual transmission (e.g. when the
server or the peer is running \fBchronyd\fP with software (kernel) or hardware
timestamping). This can significantly improve the accuracy of the measurements.
.sp
The interleaved mode is compatible with servers that support only the basic
mode, but peers must both support and have enabled the interleaved mode,
otherwise the synchronisation will work only in one direction. Note that even
servers that support the interleaved mode might respond in the basic mode as
the interleaved mode requires the servers to keep some state for each client
and the state might be dropped when there are too many clients (e.g.
\fBclientloglimit\fP is too small), or it might be overwritten
by other clients that have the same IP address (e.g. computers behind NAT or
someone sending requests with a spoofed source address).
.sp
The \fBxleave\fP option can be combined with the \fBpresend\fP option in order to
shorten the interval in which the server has to keep the state to be able to
respond in the interleaved mode.
.RE
.sp
\fBpolltarget\fP \fItarget\fP
.RS 4
Target number of measurements to use for the regression algorithm which
\fBchronyd\fP will try to maintain by adjusting the polling interval between
\fBminpoll\fP and \fBmaxpoll\fP. A higher target makes \fBchronyd\fP prefer shorter polling
intervals. The default is 8 and a useful range is from 6 to 60.
.RE
.sp
\fBport\fP \fIport\fP
.RS 4
This option allows the UDP port on which the server understands NTP requests to
be specified. For normal servers this option should not be required (the
default is 123, the standard NTP port).
.RE
.sp
\fBpresend\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
If the timing measurements being made by \fBchronyd\fP are the only network data
passing between two computers, you might find that some measurements are badly
skewed due to either the client or the server having to do an ARP lookup on the
other party prior to transmitting a packet. This is more of a problem with long
sampling intervals, which might be similar in duration to the lifetime of entries
in the ARP caches of the machines.
.sp
In order to avoid this problem, the \fBpresend\fP option can be used. It takes a
single integer argument, which is the smallest polling interval for which an
extra pair of NTP packets will be exchanged between the client and the server
prior to the actual measurement. For example, with the following option
included in a \fBserver\fP directive:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
presend 9
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
when the polling interval is 512 seconds or more, an extra NTP client packet
will be sent to the server a short time (2 seconds) before making the actual
measurement.
.sp
The \fBpresend\fP option cannot be used in the \fBpeer\fP directive. If it is used
with the \fBxleave\fP option, \fBchronyd\fP will send two extra packets instead of one.
.RE
.sp
\fBminstratum\fP \fIstratum\fP
.RS 4
When the synchronisation source is selected from available sources, sources
with lower stratum are normally slightly preferred. This option can be used to
increase stratum of the source to the specified minimum, so \fBchronyd\fP will
avoid selecting that source. This is useful with low stratum sources that are
known to be unreliable or inaccurate and which should be used only when other
sources are unreachable.
.RE
.sp
\fBversion\fP \fIversion\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the NTP version of packets sent to the server. This can be
useful when the server runs an old NTP implementation that does not respond to
requests using a newer version. The default version depends on whether a key is
specified by the \fBkey\fP option and which authentication hash function the key
is using. If the output size of the hash function is longer than 160 bits, the
default version is 3 for compatibility with older \fBchronyd\fP servers. Otherwise,
the default version is 4.
.RE
.RE
.sp
\fBpool\fP \fIname\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The syntax of this directive is similar to that for the \fBserver\fP
directive, except that it is used to specify a pool of NTP servers rather than
a single NTP server. The pool name is expected to resolve to multiple addresses
which might change over time.
.sp
All options valid in the \fBserver\fP directive can be used in this
directive too. There is one option specific to the \fBpool\fP directive:
\fBmaxsources\fP sets the maximum number of sources that can be used from the pool,
the default value is 4.
.sp
On start, when the pool name is resolved, \fBchronyd\fP will add up to 16 sources,
one for each resolved address. When the number of sources from which at least
one valid reply was received reaches the number specified by the \fBmaxsources\fP
option, the other sources will be removed. When a pool source is unreachable,
marked as a falseticker, or has a distance larger than the limit set by the
\fBmaxdistance\fP directive, \fBchronyd\fP will try to replace the
source with a newly resolved address from the pool.
.sp
An example of the \fBpool\fP directive is
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pool pool.ntp.org iburst maxsources 3
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.sp
\fBpeer\fP \fIhostname\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The syntax of this directive is identical to that for the \fBserver\fP
directive, except that it specifies a symmetric association with an NTP peer
instead of a client/server association with an NTP server. A single symmetric
association allows the peers to be both servers and clients to each other. This
is mainly useful when the NTP implementation of the peer (e.g. \fBntpd\fP) supports
ephemeral symmetric associations and does not need to be configured with an
address of this host. \fBchronyd\fP does not support ephemeral associations.
.sp
When a key is specified by the \fBkey\fP option to enable authentication, both
peers must use the same key and the same key number.
.sp
Note that the symmetric mode is less secure than the client/server mode. A
denial\-of\-service attack is possible on unauthenticated symmetric associations,
i.e. when the peer was specified without the \fBkey\fP option. An attacker who does
not see network traffic between two hosts, but knows that they are peering with
each other, can periodically send them unauthenticated packets with spoofed
source addresses in order to disrupt their NTP state and prevent them from
synchronising to each other. When the association is authenticated, an attacker
who does see the network traffic, but cannot prevent the packets from reaching
the other host, can still disrupt the state by replaying old packets. The
attacker has effectively the same power as a man\-in\-the\-middle attacker. A
partial protection against this attack is implemented in \fBchronyd\fP, which can
protect the peers if they are using the same polling interval and they never
sent an authenticated packet with a timestamp from future, but it should not be
relied on as it is difficult to ensure the conditions are met. If two hosts
should be able to synchronise to each other in both directions, it is
recommended to use two separate client/server associations (specified by the
\fBserver\fP directive on both hosts) instead.
.RE
.sp
\fBinitstepslew\fP \fIstep\-threshold\fP [\fIhostname\fP]...
.RS 4
In normal operation, \fBchronyd\fP slews the time when it needs to adjust the
system clock. For example, to correct a system clock which is 1 second slow,
\fBchronyd\fP slightly increases the amount by which the system clock is advanced
on each clock interrupt, until the error is removed. Note that at no time does
time run backwards with this method.
.sp
On most Unix systems it is not desirable to step the system clock, because many
programs rely on time advancing monotonically forwards.
.sp
When the \fBchronyd\fP daemon is initially started, it is possible that the system
clock is considerably in error. Attempting to correct such an error by slewing
might not be sensible, since it might take several hours to correct the error by
this means.
.sp
The purpose of the \fBinitstepslew\fP directive is to allow \fBchronyd\fP to make a
rapid measurement of the system clock error at boot time, and to correct the
system clock by stepping before normal operation begins. Since this would
normally be performed only at an appropriate point in the system boot sequence,
no other software should be adversely affected by the step.
.sp
If the correction required is less than a specified threshold, a slew is used
instead. This makes it safer to restart \fBchronyd\fP whilst the system is in
normal operation.
.sp
The \fBinitstepslew\fP directive takes a threshold and a list of NTP servers as
arguments. Each of the servers is rapidly polled several times, and a majority
voting mechanism used to find the most likely range of system clock error that
is present. A step or slew is applied to the system clock to correct this
error. \fBchronyd\fP then enters its normal operating mode.
.sp
An example of the use of the directive is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
initstepslew 30 foo.example.net bar.example.net
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
where 2 NTP servers are used to make the measurement. The \fI30\fP indicates that
if the system\(cqs error is found to be 30 seconds or less, a slew will be used to
correct it; if the error is above 30 seconds, a step will be used.
.sp
The \fBinitstepslew\fP directive can also be used in an isolated LAN environment,
where the clocks are set manually. The most stable computer is chosen as the
master, and the other computers are slaved to it. If each of the slaves is
configured with the \fBlocal\fP directive, the master can be set up with
an \fBinitstepslew\fP directive which references some or all of the slaves. Then,
if the master machine has to be rebooted, the slaves can be relied on to act
analogously to a flywheel and preserve the time for a short period while the
master completes its reboot.
.sp
The \fBinitstepslew\fP directive is functionally similar to a combination of the
\fBmakestep\fP and \fBserver\fP directives with the \fBiburst\fP
option. The main difference is that the \fBinitstepslew\fP servers are used only
before normal operation begins and that the foreground \fBchronyd\fP process waits
for \fBinitstepslew\fP to finish before exiting. This is useful to prevent programs
started in the boot sequence after \fBchronyd\fP from reading the clock before it
has been stepped.
.RE
.sp
\fBrefclock\fP \fIdriver\fP \fIparameter\fP[:\fIoption\fP]... [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The \fBrefclock\fP directive specifies a hardware reference clock to be used as a
time source. It has two mandatory parameters, a driver name and a
driver\-specific parameter. The two parameters are followed by zero or more
refclock options. Some drivers have special options, which can be appended to
the driver\-specific parameter using the \fB:\fP character.
.sp
There are four drivers included in \fBchronyd\fP:
.sp
\fBPPS\fP
.RS 4
Driver for the kernel PPS (pulse per second) API. The parameter is the path to
the PPS device (typically \fI/dev/pps?\fP). As PPS refclocks do not supply full
time, another time source (e.g. NTP server or non\-PPS refclock) is needed to
complete samples from the PPS refclock. An alternative is to enable the
\fBlocal\fP directive to allow synchronisation with some unknown but
constant offset. The driver supports the following option:
.sp
\fBclear\fP
.RS 4
By default, the PPS refclock uses assert events (rising edge) for
synchronisation. With this option, it will use clear events (falling edge)
instead.
.RE

.RE
.sp
\fBSHM\fP
.RS 4
NTP shared memory driver. This driver uses a shared memory segment to receive
samples from another process (e.g. \fBgpsd\fP). The parameter is the number of the
shared memory segment, typically a small number like 0, 1, 2, or 3. The driver
supports the following option:
.sp
\fBperm\fP=\fImode\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the permissions of the shared memory segment created by
\fBchronyd\fP. They are specified as a numeric mode. The default value is 0600

.RE
.sp
\fBSOCK\fP
.RS 4
Unix domain socket driver. It is similar to the SHM driver, but samples are
received from a Unix domain socket instead of shared memory and the messages
have a different format. The parameter is the path to the socket, which
\fBchronyd\fP creates on start. An advantage over the SHM driver is that SOCK does
not require polling and it can receive PPS samples with incomplete time. The
format of the messages is described in the \fIrefclock_sock.c\fP file in the chrony
source code.
.sp
An application which supports the SOCK protocol is the \fBgpsd\fP daemon. The path
where \fBgpsd\fP expects the socket to be created is described in the \fBgpsd(8)\fP man
page. For example:

.nf
refclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttyS0.sock

.if n \{\
.RE

.RE
.sp
\fBPHC\fP
.RS 4
PTP hardware clock (PHC) driver. The parameter is the path to the device of
the PTP clock which should be used as a time source. If the clock is kept in
TAI instead of UTC (e.g. it is synchronised by a PTP daemon), the current
UTC\-TAI offset needs to be specified by the \fBoffset\fP option. Alternatively, the
\fBpps\fP refclock option can be enabled to treat the PHC as a PPS refclock, using
only the sub\-second offset for synchronisation. The driver supports the
following options:
.sp
\fBnocrossts\fP
.RS 4
This option disables use of precise cross timestamping.
.RE
.sp
\fBextpps\fP
.RS 4
This option enables a PPS mode in which the PTP clock is timestamping pulses
of an external PPS signal connected to the clock. The clock does not need to be
synchronised, but another time source is needed to complete the PPS samples.
Note that some PTP clocks cannot be configured to timestamp only assert or
clear events, and it is necessary to use the \fBwidth\fP option to filter wrong
PPS samples.

The \fBrefclock\fP directive supports the following options:
.sp
\fBpoll\fP \fIpoll\fP
.RS 4
Timestamps produced by refclock drivers are not used immediately, but they are
stored and processed by a median filter in the polling interval specified by
this option. This is defined as a power of 2 and can be negative to specify a
sub\-second interval. The default is 4 (16 seconds). A shorter interval allows
\fBchronyd\fP to react faster to changes in the frequency of the system clock, but
it might have a negative effect on its accuracy if the samples have a lot of
jitter.
.RE
.sp
\fBdpoll\fP \fIdpoll\fP
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\fBrefid\fP \fIrefid\fP
.RS 4
This option is used to specify the reference ID of the refclock, as up to four
ASCII characters. The default reference ID is composed from the first three
characters of the driver name and the number of the refclock. Each refclock
must have a unique reference ID.
.RE
.sp
\fBlock\fP \fIrefid\fP
.RS 4

.RS 4
This option sets the rate of the pulses in the PPS signal (in Hz). This option
controls how the pulses will be completed with real time. To actually receive
more than one pulse per second, a negative \fBdpoll\fP has to be specified (\-3 for
a 5Hz signal). The default is 1.

For such systems, it is possible to save the measurement history across

The \fBcombinelimit\fP directive limits which sources are included in the combining

The \fBcorrtimeratio\fP directive sets the ratio between the duration in which the

the interval in which the corrections are done (usually the NTP polling
interval). Corrections larger than the average take less time and smaller
corrections take more time, the amount of the correction and the correction
time are inversely proportional.

\fBdriftfile\fP \fIfile\fP

One of the main activities of the \fBchronyd\fP program is to work out the rate at
which the system clock gains or loses time relative to real time.
.sp
Whenever \fBchronyd\fP computes a new value of the gain or loss rate, it is desirable
to record it somewhere. This allows \fBchronyd\fP to begin compensating the system
clock at that rate whenever it is restarted, even before it has had a chance to
obtain an equally good estimate of the rate during the new run. (This process
can take many minutes, at least.)
.sp
The \fBdriftfile\fP directive allows a file to be specified into which \fBchronyd\fP
can store the rate information. Two parameters are recorded in the file. The
first is the rate at which the system clock gains or loses time, expressed in
parts per million, with gains positive. Therefore, a value of 100.0 indicates
that when the system clock has advanced by a second, it has gained 100
microseconds in reality (so the true time has only advanced by 999900
microseconds). The second is an estimate of the error bound around the first
value in which the true rate actually lies.

Fallback drifts are long\-term averages of the system clock drift calculated
over exponentially increasing intervals. They are used to avoid quickly
drifting away from true time when the clock was not updated for a longer period
of time and there was a short\-term deviation in the drift before the updates
stopped.
.sp
The directive specifies the minimum and maximum interval since the last clock
update to switch between fallback drifts. They are defined as a power of 2 (in
seconds). The syntax is as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\

fallbackdrift 16 19
.fi
.if n \{\

In this example, the minimum interval is 16 (18 hours) and the maximum interval is
19 (6 days). The system clock frequency will be set to the first fallback 18
hours after last clock update, to the second after 36 hours, and so on. This
might be a good setting to cover frequency changes due to daily and weekly
temperature fluctuations. When the frequency is set to a fallback, the state of
the clock will change to \(oqNot synchronised\(cq.

When serving time to NTP clients that cannot be configured to correct their

enable a server leap smear.
.sp
When smearing a leap second, the leap status is suppressed on the server and
the served time is corrected slowly be slewing instead of stepping. The clients
do not need any special configuration as they do not know there is any leap
second and they follow the server time which eventually brings them back to
UTC. Care must be taken to ensure they use only NTP servers which smear the
leap second in exactly the same way for synchronisation.
.sp
This feature must be used carefully, because the server is intentionally not
serving its best estimate of the true time.

The first directive is necessary to disable the clock step which would reset
the smoothing process. The second directive limits the slewing rate of the
local clock to 1000 ppm, which improves the stability of the smoothing process
when the local correction starts and ends. The third directive enables the
server time smoothing process. It will start when the clock gets to 00:00:00
UTC and it will take 17 hours 34 minutes to finish. The frequency offset will
be changing by 0.001 ppm per second and will reach a maximum of 31.623 ppm. The

This directive is useful with reference clocks and other time sources which do

It should be noted that this is not the only means of protection against using

to the file containing the current temperature from the sensor (in text
format), the compensation update interval (in seconds), and temperature
coefficients \fIT0\fP, \fIk0\fP, \fIk1\fP, \fIk2\fP.
.sp
The frequency compensation is calculated (in ppm) as
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
k0 + (T \- T0) * k1 + (T \- T0)^2 * k2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The result has to be between \-10 ppm and 10 ppm, otherwise the measurement is
considered invalid and will be ignored. The \fIk0\fP coefficient can be adjusted to
keep the compensation in that range.
.sp
An example of the use is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tempcomp /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp2_input 30 26000 0.0 0.000183 0.0
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The measured temperature will be read from the file in the Linux sysfs
filesystem every 30 seconds. When the temperature is 26000 (26 degrees
Celsius), the frequency correction will be zero. When it is 27000 (27 degrees
Celsius), the clock will be set to run faster by 0.183 ppm, etc.
.sp
The second form has three parameters: the path to the sensor file, the update
interval, and a path to a file containing a list of (temperature, compensation)
points, from which the compensation is linearly interpolated or extrapolated.
.sp
An example is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tempcomp /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp2_input 30 /etc/chrony.tempcomp
.fi
.if n \{\

where the \fI/etc/chrony.tempcomp\fP file could have

.sp
\fBallow\fP [\fBall\fP] [\fIsubnet\fP]
.RS 4
The \fBallow\fP directive is used to designate a particular subnet from which NTP
clients are allowed to access the computer as an NTP server.
.sp
The default is that no clients are allowed access, i.e. \fBchronyd\fP operates
purely as an NTP client. If the \fBallow\fP directive is used, \fBchronyd\fP will be
both a client of its servers, and a server to other clients.
.sp
Examples of the use of the directive are as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
allow 1.2.3.4
allow 1.2
allow 3.4.5
allow 6.7.8/22
allow 6.7.8.9/22
allow 2001:db8::/32
allow 0/0
allow ::/0
allow
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The first directive allows a node with IPv4 address \fI1.2.3.4\fP to be an NTP
client of this computer.
The second directive allows any node with an IPv4 address of the form \fI1.2.x.y\fP
(with \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP arbitrary) to be an NTP client of this computer. Likewise,
the third directive allows any node with an IPv4 address of the form \fI3.4.5.x\fP
to have client NTP access. The fourth and fifth forms allow access from any
node with an IPv4 address of the form \fI6.7.8.x\fP, \fI6.7.9.x\fP, \fI6.7.10.x\fP or
\fI6.7.11.x\fP (with \fIx\fP arbitrary), i.e. the value 22 is the number of bits
defining the specified subnet. In the fifth form, the final byte is ignored.
The sixth form is used for IPv6 addresses. The seventh and eighth forms allow
access by any IPv4 and IPv6 node respectively. The ninth forms allows access by
any node (IPv4 or IPv6).
.sp
A second form of the directive, \fBallow all\fP, has a greater effect, depending on
the ordering of directives in the configuration file. To illustrate the effect,
consider the two examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
allow 1.2.3.4
deny 1.2.3
allow 1.2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
and
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
allow 1.2.3.4
deny 1.2.3
allow all 1.2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the first example, the effect is the same regardless of what order the three
directives are given in. So the \fI1.2.x.y\fP subnet is allowed access, except for
the \fI1.2.3.x\fP subnet, which is denied access, however the host \fI1.2.3.4\fP is
allowed access.
.sp
In the second example, the \fBallow all 1.2\fP directives overrides the effect of
\fIany\fP previous directive relating to a subnet within the specified subnet.
Within a configuration file this capability is probably rather moot; however,
it is of greater use for reconfiguration at run\-time via \fBchronyc\fP with the
\fBallow all\fP command.
.sp
The directive allows a hostname to be specified instead of an IP address, but
the name must be resolvable when \fBchronyd\fP is started (i.e. \fBchronyd\fP needs
to be started when the network is already up and DNS is working).
.sp
Note, if the \fBinitstepslew\fP directive is used in the
configuration file, each of the computers listed in that directive must allow
client access by this computer for it to work.
.RE
.sp
\fBdeny\fP [\fBall\fP] [\fIsubnet\fP]
.RS 4
This is similar to the \fBallow\fP directive, except that it denies NTP
client access to a particular subnet or host, rather than allowing it.
.sp
The syntax is identical.
.sp
There is also a \fBdeny all\fP directive with similar behaviour to the \fBallow all\fP
directive.
.RE
.sp
\fBbindaddress\fP \fIaddress\fP
.RS 4
The \fBbindaddress\fP directive binds the socket on which \fBchronyd\fP listens for NTP
requests to a local address of the computer. On systems other than Linux, the
address of the computer needs to be already configured when \fBchronyd\fP is
started.
.sp
An example of the use of the directive is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bindaddress 192.168.1.1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Currently, for each of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, only one \fBbindaddress\fP
directive can be specified. Therefore, it is not useful on computers which
should serve NTP on multiple network interfaces.
.RE
.sp
\fBbroadcast\fP \fIinterval\fP \fIaddress\fP [\fIport\fP]
.RS 4
The \fBbroadcast\fP directive is used to declare a broadcast address to which
chronyd should send packets in the NTP broadcast mode (i.e. make \fBchronyd\fP act
as a broadcast server). Broadcast clients on that subnet will be able to
synchronise.
.sp
The syntax is as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
broadcast 30 192.168.1.255
broadcast 60 192.168.2.255 12123
broadcast 60 ff02::101
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the first example, the destination port defaults to UDP port 123 (the normal NTP
port). In the second example, the destination port is specified as 12123. The
first parameter in each case (30 or 60 respectively) is the interval in seconds
between broadcast packets being sent. The second parameter in each case is the
broadcast address to send the packet to. This should correspond to the
broadcast address of one of the network interfaces on the computer where
\fBchronyd\fP is running.
.sp
You can have more than 1 \fBbroadcast\fP directive if you have more than 1 network
interface onto which you want to send NTP broadcast packets.
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP itself cannot act as a broadcast client; it must always be configured
as a point\-to\-point client by defining specific NTP servers and peers. This
broadcast server feature is intended for providing a time source to other NTP
implementations.
.sp
If \fBntpd\fP is used as the broadcast client, it will try to measure the
round\-trip delay between the server and client with normal client mode packets.
Thus, the broadcast subnet should also be the subject of an \fBallow\fP
directive.
.RE
.sp
\fBclientloglimit\fP \fIlimit\fP
.RS 4
This directive specifies the maximum amount of memory that \fBchronyd\fP is allowed
to allocate for logging of client accesses and the state that \fBchronyd\fP as an
NTP server needs to support the interleaved mode for its clients. The default
limit is 524288 bytes, which is sufficient for monitoring about four thousand
clients at the same time.
.sp
In older \fBchrony\fP versions if the limit was set to 0, the memory allocation was
unlimited.
.sp
An example of the use of this directive is:
.sp
.if n \{\

\fBnoclientlog\fP

This directive, which takes no arguments, specifies that client accesses are
not to be logged. Normally they are logged, allowing statistics to be reported
using the \fBclients\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP. This option
also effectively disables server support for the NTP interleaved mode.
.RE
.sp
\fBlocal\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
The \fBlocal\fP directive enables a local reference mode, which allows \fBchronyd\fP
operating as an NTP server to appear synchronised to real time (from the
viewpoint of clients polling it), even when it was never synchronised or
the last update of the clock happened a long time ago.
.sp
This directive is normally used in an isolated network, where computers are
required to be synchronised to one another, but not necessarily to real time.
The server can be kept vaguely in line with real time by manual input.
.sp
The \fBlocal\fP directive has the following options:
.sp
\fBstratum\fP \fIstratum\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the stratum of the server which will be reported to clients
when the local reference is active. The specified value is in the range 1
through 15, and the default value is 10. It should be larger than the maximum
expected stratum in the network when external NTP servers are accessible.
.sp
Stratum 1 indicates a computer that has a true real\-time reference directly
connected to it (e.g. GPS, atomic clock, etc.), such computers are expected to
be very close to real time. Stratum 2 computers are those which have a stratum
1 server; stratum 3 computers have a stratum 2 server and so on. A value
of 10 indicates that the clock is so many hops away from a reference clock that
its time is fairly unreliable.
.RE
.sp
\fBdistance\fP \fIdistance\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the threshold for the root distance which will activate the local
reference. If \fBchronyd\fP was synchronised to some source, the local reference
will not be activated until its root distance reaches the specified value (the
rate at which the distance is increasing depends on how well the clock was
tracking the source). The default value is 1 second.
.sp
The current root distance can be calculated from root delay and root dispersion
(reported by the \fBtracking\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP) as:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
distance = delay / 2 + dispersion
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.sp
\fBorphan\fP
.RS 4
This option enables a special \(oqorphan\(cq mode, where sources with stratum equal
to the local \fIstratum\fP are assumed to not serve real time. They are ignored
unless no other source is selectable and their reference IDs are smaller than
the local reference ID.
.sp
This allows multiple servers in the network to use the same \fBlocal\fP
configuration and to be synchronised to one another, without confusing clients
that poll more than one server. Each server needs to be configured to poll all
other servers with the \fBlocal\fP directive. This ensures only the server with the
smallest reference ID has the local reference active and others are
synchronised to it. When that server fails, another will take over.
.sp
The \fBorphan\fP mode is compatible with the \fBntpd\fP\(cqs orphan mode (enabled by the
\fBtos orphan\fP command).

\fBntpsigndsocket\fP \fIdirectory\fP

This directive specifies the location of the Samba \fBntp_signd\fP socket when it
is running as a Domain Controller (DC). If \fBchronyd\fP is compiled with this
feature, responses to MS\-SNTP clients will be signed by the \fBsmbd\fP daemon.
.sp
Note that MS\-SNTP requests are not authenticated and any client that is allowed
to access the server by the \fBallow\fP directive, or the
\fBallow\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP, can get an MS\-SNTP
response signed with a trust account\(cqs password and try to crack the password
in a brute\-force attack. Access to the server should be carefully controlled.
.sp
An example of the directive is:

\fBport\fP \fIport\fP

NTP requests. The port will be open only when an address is allowed by the
\fBallow\fP directive or the \fBallow\fP command in
\fBchronyc\fP, an NTP peer is configured, or the broadcast server mode is enabled.
.sp
The default value is 123, the standard NTP port. If set to 0, \fBchronyd\fP will
never open the server port and will operate strictly in a client\-only mode. The
source port used in NTP client requests can be set by the
\fBacquisitionport\fP directive.
.RE
.sp
\fBratelimit\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
This directive enables response rate limiting for NTP packets. Its purpose is
to reduce network traffic with misconfigured or broken NTP clients that are
polling the server too frequently. The limits are applied to individual IP
addresses. If multiple clients share one IP address (e.g. multiple hosts behind
NAT), the sum of their traffic will be limited. If a client that increases its
polling rate when it does not receive a reply is detected, its rate limiting
will be temporarily suspended to avoid increasing the overall amount of
traffic. The maximum number of IP addresses which can be monitored at the same
time depends on the memory limit set by the \fBclientloglimit\fP
directive.
.sp
The \fBratelimit\fP directive supports a number of options (which can be defined
in any order):
.sp
\fBinterval\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the minimum interval between responses. It is defined as a
power of 2 in seconds. The default value is 3 (8 seconds). The minimum value
is \-19 (524288 packets per second) and the maximum value is 12 (one packet per
4096 seconds). Note that with values below \-4 the rate limiting is coarse
(responses are allowed in bursts, even if the interval between them is shorter
than the specified interval).
.RE
.sp
\fBburst\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the maximum number of responses that can be sent in a burst,
temporarily exceeding the limit specified by the \fBinterval\fP option. This is
useful for clients that make rapid measurements on start (e.g. \fBchronyd\fP with
the \fBiburst\fP option). The default value is 8. The minimum value is 1 and the
maximum value is 255.
.RE
.sp
\fBleak\fP
.RS 4
This option sets the rate at which responses are randomly allowed even if the
limits specified by the \fBinterval\fP and \fBburst\fP options are exceeded. This is
necessary to prevent an attacker who is sending requests with a spoofed
source address from completely blocking responses to that address. The leak
rate is defined as a power of 1/2 and it is 2 by default, i.e. on average at
least every fourth request has a response. The minimum value is 1 and the
maximum value is 4.

This would reduce the response rate for IP addresses sending packets on average
more than once per 2 seconds, or sending packets in bursts of more than 16

.RE
.sp
\fBsmoothtime\fP \fImax\-freq\fP \fImax\-wander\fP [\fBleaponly\fP]
.RS 4
The \fBsmoothtime\fP directive can be used to enable smoothing of the time that
\fBchronyd\fP serves to its clients to make it easier for them to track it and keep
their clocks close together even when large offset or frequency corrections are
applied to the server\(cqs clock, for example after being offline for a longer
time.
.sp
BE WARNED: The server is intentionally not serving its best estimate of the
true time. If a large offset has been accumulated, it can take a very long time
to smooth it out. This directive should be used only when the clients are not
configured to also poll another NTP server, because they could reject this
server as a falseticker or fail to select a source completely.
.sp
The smoothing process is implemented with a quadratic spline function with two
or three pieces. It is independent from any slewing applied to the local system
clock, but the accumulated offset and frequency will be reset when the clock is
corrected by stepping, e.g. by the \fBmakestep\fP directive or the
\fBmakestep\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP. The process can be
reset without stepping the clock by the \fBsmoothtime
reset\fP command.
.sp
The first two arguments of the directive are the maximum frequency offset of
the smoothed time to the tracked NTP time (in ppm) and the maximum rate at
which the frequency offset is allowed to change (in ppm per second). \fBleaponly\fP
is an optional third argument which enables a mode where only leap seconds are
smoothed out and normal offset and frequency changes are ignored. The \fBleaponly\fP
option is useful in a combination with the \fBleapsecmode slew\fP
directive to allow the clients to use multiple time smoothing servers safely.
.sp
The smoothing process is activated automatically when 1/10000 of the estimated
skew of the local clock falls below the maximum rate of frequency change. It
can be also activated manually by the \fBsmoothtime
activate\fP command, which is particularly useful when the clock is
synchronised only with manual input and the skew is always larger than the
threshold. The \fBsmoothing\fP command can be used to
monitor the process.
.sp

\fBbindcmdaddress\fP \fIaddress\fP
.RS 4
The \fBbindcmdaddress\fP directive allows you to specify an IP address of an
interface on which \fBchronyd\fP will listen for monitoring command packets (issued
by \fBchronyc\fP). On systems other than Linux, the address of the interface needs
to be already configured when \fBchronyd\fP is started.
.sp
This directive can also change the path of the Unix domain command socket,
which is used by \fBchronyc\fP to send configuration commands. The socket must be
in a directory that is accessible only by the root or \fIchrony\fP user. The
directory will be created on start if it does not exist. The compiled\-in default
path of the socket is \fI@CHRONYRUNDIR@/chronyd.sock\fP. The socket can be
disabled by setting the path to \fI/\fP.
.sp
By default, \fBchronyd\fP binds to the loopback interface (with addresses
\fI127.0.0.1\fP and \fI::1\fP). This blocks all access except from localhost. To listen
for command packets on all interfaces, you can add the lines:
.sp

\fBrtconutc\fP
.RS 4
\fBchronyd\fP assumes by default that the RTC keeps local time (including any
daylight saving changes). This is convenient on PCs running Linux which are
dual\-booted with Windows.
.sp
If you keep the RTC on local time and your computer is off when daylight saving
(summer time) starts or ends, the computer\(cqs system time will be one hour in
error when you next boot and start chronyd.
.sp
An alternative is for the RTC to keep Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This
does not suffer from the 1 hour problem when daylight saving starts or ends.
.sp
If the \fBrtconutc\fP directive appears, it means the RTC is required to keep UTC.
The directive takes no arguments. It is equivalent to specifying the \fB\-u\fP
switch to the Linux \fBhwclock\fP program.
.sp
Note that this setting is overridden by the \fBhwclockfile\fP file
and is not relevant for the \fBrtcsync\fP directive.

\fBrtcsync\fP
.RS 4
The \fBrtcsync\fP directive enables a mode where the system time is periodically
copied to the RTC and \fBchronyd\fP does not try to track its drift. This directive
cannot be used with the \fBrtcfile\fP directive.
.sp
On Linux, the RTC copy is performed by the kernel every 11 minutes.
.sp
On macOS, \fBchronyd\fP will perform the RTC copy every 60 minutes
when the system clock is in a synchronised state.

On other systems this directive does nothing.

\fBhwtimestamp\fP \fIinterface\fP [\fIoption\fP]...
.RS 4
This directive enables hardware timestamping of NTP packets sent to and
received from the specified network interface. The network interface controller
(NIC) uses its own clock to accurately timestamp the actual transmissions and
receptions, avoiding processing and queueing delays in the kernel, network
driver, and hardware. This can significantly improve the accuracy of the
timestamps and the measured offset, which is used for synchronisation of the
system clock. In order to get the best results, both sides receiving and
sending NTP packets (i.e. server and client, or two peers) need to use HW
timestamping. If the server or peer supports the interleaved mode, it needs to
be enabled by the \fBxleave\fP option in the \fBserver\fP or the
\fBpeer\fP directive.
.sp
This directive is supported on Linux 3.19 and newer. The NIC must support HW
timestamping, which can be verified with the \fBethtool \-T\fP command. The list of
capabilities should include \fISOF_TIMESTAMPING_RAW_HARDWARE\fP,
\fISOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_HARDWARE\fP, and \fISOF_TIMESTAMPING_RX_HARDWARE\fP. Receive
filter \fIHWTSTAMP_FILTER_ALL\fP, or \fIHWTSTAMP_FILTER_NTP_ALL\fP, is necessary for
timestamping of received packets. Timestamping of packets received from bridged
and bonded interfaces is supported on Linux 4.13 and newer. When \fBchronyd\fP is
running, no other process (e.g. a PTP daemon) should be working with the NIC
clock.
.sp
If the kernel supports software timestamping, it will be enabled for all
interfaces. The source of timestamps (i.e. hardware, kernel, or daemon) is
indicated in the \fImeasurements.log\fP file if enabled by the \fBlog
measurements\fP directive, and the \fBntpdata\fP report in
\fBchronyc\fP.

If the specified interface is \fI*\fP, \fBchronyd\fP will try to enable HW timestamping
on all available interfaces.

.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
Each line consists of an ID, name of an authentication hash function (optional),
and a password. The ID can be any unsigned integer in the range 1 through
2^32\-1. The default hash function is \fBMD5\fP, which is always supported.
.sp
If \fBchronyd\fP was built with enabled support for hashing using a crypto library
(nettle, nss, or libtomcrypt), the following functions are available: \fBMD5\fP,
\fBSHA1\fP, \fBSHA256\fP, \fBSHA384\fP, \fBSHA512\fP. Depending on which library and version is
\fBchronyd\fP using, some or all of the following functions may also be available:
\fBSHA3\-224\fP, \fBSHA3\-256\fP, \fBSHA3\-384\fP, \fBSHA3\-512\fP, \fBRMD128\fP, \fBRMD160\fP, \fBRMD256\fP,
\fBRMD320\fP, \fBTIGER\fP, \fBWHIRLPOOL\fP.
.sp
The password can be specified as a string of characters not containing white
space with an optional \fBASCII:\fP prefix, or as a hexadecimal number with the
\fBHEX:\fP prefix. The maximum length of the line is 2047 characters.
.sp
The password is used with the hash function to generate and verify a message
authentication code (MAC) in NTP packets. It is recommended to use SHA1, or
stronger, hash function with random passwords specified in the hexadecimal
format that have at least 128 bits. \fBchronyd\fP will log a warning to
syslog on start if a source is specified in the configuration file with a key
that has password shorter than 80 bits.
.sp
The \fBkeygen\fP command of \fBchronyc\fP can be used to
generate random keys for the key file. By default, it generates 160\-bit MD5 or
SHA1 keys.
.sp
For security reasons, the file should be readable only by root and the user
under which \fBchronyd\fP is normally running (to allow \fBchronyd\fP to re\-read the
file when the \fBrekey\fP command is issued by \fBchronyc\fP).

The \fBlock_all\fP directive will lock chronyd into RAM so that it will never be

On Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris, the \fBsched_priority\fP directive will

be between 0 and 100). On macOS, this option must have either a value of 0 (the
default) to disable the thread time constraint policy or 1 for the policy to be
enabled.
.sp
On systems other than macOS, this directive uses the \fBpthread_setschedparam()\fP
system call to instruct the kernel to use the SCHED_FIFO first\-in, first\-out
real\-time scheduling policy for \fBchronyd\fP with the specified priority. This
means that whenever \fBchronyd\fP is ready to run it will run, interrupting
whatever else is running unless it is a higher priority real\-time process. This
should not impact performance as \fBchronyd\fP resource requirements are modest,
but it should result in lower and more consistent latency since \fBchronyd\fP will
not need to wait for the scheduler to get around to running it. You should not
use this unless you really need it. The \fBpthread_setschedparam(3)\fP man page has
more details.

On macOS, this directive uses the \fBthread_policy_set()\fP kernel call to

.sp
Again, assuming that your NTP servers are called \fIfoo.example.net\fP,

\fBchronyd\fP\(cqs polling of the servers would now only occur whilst the machine is

.SS "Isolated networks"
.sp
This section shows how to configure \fBchronyd\fP for computers that never have
network conectivity to any computer which ultimately derives its time from a
reference clock.
.sp
In this situation, one computer is selected to be the master timeserver. The
other computers are either direct clients of the master, or clients of clients.
.sp
The \fBlocal\fP directive enables a local reference mode, which allows
\fBchronyd\fP to appear synchronised even when it is not.
.sp
The rate value in the master\(cqs drift file needs to be set to the average rate
at which the master gains or loses time. \fBchronyd\fP includes support for this,
in the form of the \fBmanual\fP directive and the
\fBsettime\fP command in the \fBchronyc\fP program.
.sp
If the master is rebooted, \fBchronyd\fP can re\-read the drift rate from the drift
file. However, the master has no accurate estimate of the current time. To get
around this, the system can be configured so that the master can initially set
itself to a \(oqmajority\-vote\(cq of selected clients\(aq times; this allows the
clients to \(oqflywheel\(cq the master while it is rebooting.
.sp
The \fBsmoothtime\fP directive is useful when the clocks of the
clients need to stay close together when the local time is adjusted by the
\fBsettime\fP command. The smoothing process needs to be
activated by the \fBsmoothtime activate\fP command when
the local time is ready to be served. After that point, any adjustments will be
smoothed out.
.sp
A typical configuration file for the master (called \fImaster\fP) might be
(assuming the clients and the master are in the \fI192.168.165.x\fP subnet):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.if n \{\

.sp
The rest of the clients would be the same, except that the \fBallow\fP directive is
not required.
.sp
If there is no suitable computer to be designated as the master, or there is a
requirement to keep the clients synchronised even when it fails, the \fBorphan\fP
option of the \fBlocal\fP directive enables a special mode where the master is
selected from multiple computers automatically. They all need to use the same
\fBlocal\fP configuration and poll one another. The server with the smallest
reference ID (which is based on its IP address) will take the role of the
master and others will be synchronised to it. When it fails, the server with
the second smallest reference ID will take over and so on.
.sp
A configuration file for the first server might be (assuming there are three
servers called \fImaster1\fP, \fImaster2\fP, and \fImaster3\fP):
.sp
.if n \{\

clients might be configured to poll all three servers.
.SS "RTC tracking"
.sp
This section considers a computer which has occasional connections to the
Internet and is turned off between \(oqsessions\(cq. In this case, \fBchronyd\fP relies
on the computer\(cqs RTC to maintain the time between the periods when it is
powered up. It assumes that Linux is run exclusively on the computer. Dual\-boot
systems might work; it depends what (if anything) the other system does to the
RTC. On 2.6 and later kernels, if your motherboard has a HPET, you will need to
enable the \fBHPET_EMULATE_RTC\fP option in your kernel configuration. Otherwise,
\fBchronyd\fP will not be able to interact with the RTC device and will give up
using it.
.sp
When the computer is connected to the Internet, \fBchronyd\fP has access to
external NTP servers which it makes measurements from. These measurements are
saved, and straight\-line fits are performed on them to provide an estimate of
the computer\(cqs time error and rate of gaining or losing time.
.sp
When the computer is taken offline from the Internet, the best estimate of the
gain or loss rate is used to free\-run the computer until it next goes online.
.sp
Whilst the computer is running, \fBchronyd\fP makes measurements of the RTC (via
the \fI/dev/rtc\fP interface, which must be compiled into the kernel). An estimate
is made of the RTC error at a particular RTC second, and the rate at which the
RTC gains or loses time relative to true time.
.sp
When the computer is powered down, the measurement histories for all the NTP
servers are saved to files, and the RTC tracking information is also
saved to a file (if the \fBrtcfile\fP directive has been specified).
These pieces of information are also saved if the \fBdump\fP
and \fBwritertc\fP commands respectively are issued
through \fBchronyc\fP.
.sp
When the computer is rebooted, \fBchronyd\fP reads the current RTC time and the RTC
information saved at the last shutdown. This information is used to set the
system clock to the best estimate of what its time would have been now, had it
been left running continuously. The measurement histories for the servers are
then reloaded.
.sp
The next time the computer goes online, the previous sessions\(aq measurements can
contribute to the line\-fitting process, which gives a much better estimate of
the computer\(cqs gain or loss rate.
.sp
One problem with saving the measurements and RTC data when the machine is shut
down is what happens if there is a power failure; the most recent data will not
be saved. Although \fBchronyd\fP is robust enough to cope with this, some
performance might be lost. (The main danger arises if the RTC has been changed
during the session, with the \fBtrimrtc\fP command in \fBchronyc\fP. Because of this,
\fBtrimrtc\fP will make sure that a meaningful RTC file is saved after the
change is completed).
.sp
The easiest protection against power failure is to put the \fBdump\fP and
\fBwritertc\fP commands in the same place as the \fBoffline\fP command is issued to
take \fBchronyd\fP offline; because \fBchronyd\fP free\-runs between online sessions, no
parameters will change significantly between going offline from the Internet
and any power failure.
.sp
A final point regards computers which are left running for extended periods and
where it is desired to spin down the hard disc when it is not in use (e.g. when
not accessed for 15 minutes). \fBchronyd\fP has been planned so it supports such
operation; this is the reason why the RTC tracking parameters are not saved to
disc after every update, but only when the user requests such a write, or
during the shutdown sequence. The only other facility that will generate
periodic writes to the disc is the \fBlog rtc\fP facility in the configuration
file; this option should not be used if you want your disc to spin down.
.sp
To illustrate how a computer might be configured for this case, example
configuration files are shown.
.sp
For the \fIchrony.conf\fP file, the following can be used as an example.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}

\fBpppd\fP is used for connecting to the Internet. This runs two scripts
\fI/etc/ppp/ip\-up\fP and \fI/etc/ppp/ip\-down\fP when the link goes online and offline
respectively.
.sp
The relevant part of the \fI/etc/ppp/ip\-up\fP file is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
@BINDIR@/chronyc online
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
and the relevant part of the \fI/etc/ppp/ip\-down\fP script is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
@BINDIR@/chronyc \-m offline dump writertc
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP is started during the boot sequence with the \fB\-r\fP and \fB\-s\fP options.
It might need to be started before any software that depends on the system clock
not jumping or moving backwards, depending on the directives in \fBchronyd\fP\(cqs
configuration file.
.sp
For the system shutdown, \fBchronyd\fP should receive a SIGTERM several seconds
before the final SIGKILL; the SIGTERM causes the measurement histories and RTC
information to be saved.
.SS "Public NTP server"
.sp
\fBchronyd\fP can be configured to operate as a public NTP server, e.g. to join the
.URL "http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/join.html" "pool.ntp.org" " "
project. The configuration
is similar to the NTP client with permanent connection, except it needs to
allow client access from all addresses. It is recommended to find at least four
good servers (e.g. from the pool, or on the NTP homepage). If the server has a
hardware reference clock (e.g. a GPS receiver), it can be specified by the
\fBrefclock\fP directive.
.sp
The amount of memory used for logging client accesses can be increased in order
to enable clients to use the interleaved mode even when the server has a large
number of clients, and better support rate limiting if it is enabled by the
\fBratelimit\fP directive. The system timezone database, if it is
kept up to date and includes the \fIright/UTC\fP timezone, can be used as a
reliable source to determine when a leap second will be applied to UTC. The
\fB\-r\fP option with the \fBdumpdir\fP directive shortens the time in which
\fBchronyd\fP will not be able to serve time to its clients when it needs to be
restarted (e.g. after upgrading to a newer version, or a change in the
configuration).
.sp
The configuration file could look like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
server foo.example.net iburst
server bar.example.net iburst
server baz.example.net iburst
server qux.example.net iburst
