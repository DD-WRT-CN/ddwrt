The gettext-dummy library provides stubs for gettext() family of functions.
The library might be useful when porting a progarm that requires these
functions to a system that does not provide them neither in libc nor with
a separate libintl library. The proper way to fix this problem is to use
GNU gettext, but in some rare cases it might make sense to use gettext-dummy
instead. For instance, if proper I18N is not important for your project and
you do not want to waste your time porting GNU gettext. Or if your target
system is extremely resource scarce.
