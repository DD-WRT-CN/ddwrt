1. CONTENT OF DELIVERY

1.1 SOURCE CODE CONTENT

The DSL CPE API is designed to fulfill a wide spectrum of applications.
Support for both low footprint as well as premium applications results in a
comprehensive source code content/structure. However please note that depending
on the used configuration
a) there are files available that you might not need at all
   (for example OS specific files)
b) even the needed files includes various configuration specific parts that
   might be not used for the selected configuration
As a result the lines of code (LOC) that are finally compiled/used are usually
much smaller than the available LOC.
For more details please also refer to chapter "3. Getting Started" within
"User's Manual Programmers Reference" (UMPR) of the DSL CPE API


1.2 SOURCE TREE STRUCTURE

Source tree structure for the DSL CPE Control application.

Please note that
a) the following tree does not include ALL files, it is just to get an easier
   overview about which parts might be important for the needed configuration
b) the usage of "<device>" indicates that a device specific file will be
   available according to the used source code delivery type.
   Currently there are deliveries as follows
   - "danube": Danube Family (includes Danube, Amazon-SE and AR9)
   - "vinax": Vinax
