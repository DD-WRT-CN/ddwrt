Building OpenDPI
================

OpenDPI is built using autotools and a gnu compatible C compiler like gcc.
To build the OpenDPI_demo application an installation of libpcap and the libpcap developer files are required.

Building an OpenDPI release from the command line:
	
	$ tar xvfz opendpi-1.1.0.tar.gz
	$ cd opendpi-1.1.0
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ su (if necessary for the next line)
	$ make install
	

Building OpenDPI from SVN (First Time):

	$ svn checkout http://opendpi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ opendpi
	$ cd opendpi
	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ make
	$ su (if necessary for the next line)
	$ make install
	

Building OpenDPI from SVN (Updating):
	
	$ cd opendpi
	$ make clean
	$ svn up
	$ make
	$ su (if necessary for the next line)
	$ make install
