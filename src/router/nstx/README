	NSTX Release V1.0 (first public release)

The full text of out legal notices is contained in the file called COPYING,
included with this distribution.

NSTX works only for linux at the moment. Ports to *BSD are underway.

You need to have the ethertap-dev up and running on both sides of the tunnel.
Configure e.g. 192.168.0.1 on one ethertap and 192.168.0.2 on the other end.
Then create a netroute for 192.168.0.0/24 through the ethertap (on both sides).
Client and server both assume, that the ethertap-sevice is /dev/tap0.

Then start the server on one end:
./nstxd tun.yomama.com

and the client on the other end:
./nstxcd tun.yomama.com 125.23.53.12

125.23.53.12 has to be a DNS-server which can be reached by the client-side.
The server *must* run on a server where an NS-record for tun.yomama.com points
to. So if the server has the IP 1.2.3.4 there must exist an entry in the
zonefile of yomama.com: tun	IN NS	1.2.3.4

Now it should be possible to ping 192.168.0.2 from 192.168.0.1 and the other
way round:

Note: the flow is optimized from client to server. server to client too works
      fine, but it's not as good

Note: The timing of the client is optimized for an 64k-line at the moment.
      Without modifications you shouldn't get more than 4 kb/sec even on
      faster lines

Have fun ;)
