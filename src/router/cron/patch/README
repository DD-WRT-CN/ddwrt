1. RPM source code

   It's Mandrake souce RPM. I ever downloaded the original tarball,
   but it can't be compiled successfully.

       rpm -ivh vixie-cron-3.0.1-54mdk.src.rpm

   ( Note: Make sure that you have directory "/usr/src/RPM/SOURCE".) 
   

2. Patch the source code

   After the souce RPM installed, you can find the vixie-cron original
   package and some patch files, for some flaws and Linux compliant. 

       cd /usr/src/RPM/SOURCE
       cat vixie-cron-3.0.1.tar.bz2 | bunzip2 - | tar xvf -

   Collect those patch files.

       cat vixie*patch* | bunzip2 - > vixie.all.patch

   Patch it.
     
       mv vixie.all.patch vixie-cron-3.0.1
       cd vixie-cron-3.0.1
       patch -p1 < vixie.all.patch

   You might find that few files will be rejected, then try to modify by 
   yourself.


3. Compile it

   Move the souce code into here, and change its parent 'Makefile'.

4. Install

   Make sure you have directory "/etc/cron.d", and the 'crontab' file
   should be in the '/tmp' directory.
