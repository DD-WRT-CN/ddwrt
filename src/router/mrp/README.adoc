# Media Redundancy Protocol(MRP)

This application is used to configure the kernel via netlink interface to
offload to HW the transmition of MRP_Test frames and the detection when the ring
becomes open or closed.

## MRP

This is the first proposal of implementing a subset of the standard. It supports
only 3 roles of an MRP node. It supports Media Redundancy Manager(MRM), Media
Redundancy Client(MRC) and Media Redundancy Auto-Manager(MRA) In a MRP ring,
each node needs to support MRP and in a ring can be only one MRM and multiple
MRC. It is possible to have multiple instances of MRP on a single node. But a
port can be part of only one MRP instance.

The MRM is responsible for detecting when there is a loop in the ring. It is
sending the frame MRP_Test to detect the loops. It would send MRP_Test on both
ports in the ring and if the frame is received at the other end, then the ring
is closed. Meaning that there is a loop. In this case it sets the port state to
BLOCKED, not allowing traffic to pass through except MRP frames. In case it
stops receiving MRP_Test frames from itself then the MRM will detect that the
ring is open, therefor it would notify the other nodes of this change and will
set the state of the port to be FORWARDING.

The MRC is responsible for forwarding MRP_Test frames between the ring ports
(and not to flood on other ports) and to listen when there is a change in the
network to clear the FDB.

## Depedencies

It depens on the following libs Linux 5.8, 'libnl', 'libev' and 'libmnl'

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j12
```

## Usage

First the server needs to be start. Using the command

```bash
mrp_server &
```

If the kernel doesn't support MRP, then the server will print an error message
and will exit. It is required for the kernel to be compiled with the config
CONFIG_BRIDGE_MRP.

Before configuring the mrp instance it is required to create a bridge and add at
least 2 ports to the bridge.

```bash
ip link set dev eth0 up
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip link set dev eth2 up
ip link set dev eth3 up
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set dev eth0 master br0
ip link set dev eth1 master br0
ip link set dev eth2 master br0
ip link set dev eth3 master br0
ip link set dev br0 up
```
Now that the bridge is created, it is possible to add an MRP instance to the
bridge. The client will communicate with the server and the server will notify
the kernel via netlink interface.

```bash
mrp addmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 1 pport eth0 sport eth1 ring_role mrm
```

It is possible to create multiple MRP instances on a bridge but, a port can't be
in multiple MRP instances.

```bash
mrp addmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 2 pport eth2 sport eth3 ring_role mrm
```
To see the current status of the MRP instances:

```bash
mrp getmrp
bridge: br0 ring_nr: 1 pport: eth0 sport: eth1 ring_role: MRM ring_state: CHK_RO
bridge: br0 ring_nr: 2 pport: eth2 sport: eth3 ring_role: MRM ring_state: CHK_RC
```

To delete one of the instances is required to pass the bridge and the ring
instance number:
```bash
mrp delmrp bridge br0 ring_nr 1
bridge: br0 ring_nr: 2 pport: eth2 sport: eth3 ring_role: MRM ring_state: CHK_RC
```
