Longer term:

- We have a tiny deviation from IEEE 802.1d: we don't kill the awaiting-tx
  skb queue when a port leaves the FORWARDING state. Not that anyone
  should care. But it's there.

- For the firewall add-on patch:
  - Firewalling on input or output interface?
  - How do we sort out the module vs. non-module stuff? We can have:
    - bridge compiled in, firewall disabled
    - bridge compiled in, firewall compiled in
    - bridge compiled in, firewall module
    - bridge module, firewall disabled
    - bridge module, firewall module

- RH initscripts for setting up bridge interfaces automatically. Right
  now, on my home machines, I kludge a bit. Things ought to be
  transparent, just like the bonding stuff.

- The telnet server thingy (brctld) is too limited: it does not do
  authentication (should be easy with PAM though), but more
  importantly: it does not allow setting up/down of devices and
  configuring of IP addresses. Without these, it is essentially useless.

- Improve documentation:
	* man page
	* FAQ
	* HOWTO
	  rewrite bridging howtos and update Configure.help to reflect that
