bidi.c		A quick-and-dirty hack that allows you to 'connect'
		multiple file descriptors together (everything
		received on one fd will be sent out to all the other
		fds). Works great for tying ethertaps together (for
		testing stp protocol interaction et al.).

		The command-line arguments are the names of the
		ethertaps to be connected together.


tap.c		Another quick-and-dirty hack which will let you
		connect different machine's ethertaps together over
		the network. This program works over raw IP, protocol
		number 97. RFC 1700 lists IP proto 97 as ethernet
		encapsulation; I have never seen the standard for
		this, I'm just guessing at the encapsulation being
		performed. So this program is potentially in violation
		of a standard; USE ONLY FOR TESTING!

		The first command-line argument is the name of the
		ethertap to use, the following command-line arguments
		are the hostnames of the machines to forward frames
		to.
