This is strace - a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility
with a traditional command-line interface for Linux.  It is used to monitor
and tamper with interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which
include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.
The operation of strace is made possible by the kernel feature known as ptrace.
