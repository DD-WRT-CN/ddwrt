2. Modify flush mechnism for closing port problem. 

Ver 1.12.5 (9/8/2006)
1. Add null pointer checking in npreal_net_write() to prevent from accessing invalid address.

Ver 1.12.3 (7/12/2006)
1. Support Linux kernel up to 2.6.17. 

Ver 1.12.1 (3/22/2006)
1. bugfix: Npreal2d disappeared.

Ver 1.12 (2/23/2006)
1. Offical release.
2. new: Add termio CMSPAR option. Now the driver supports MARK and SPACE parity checks.
3. bugfix: Use access_ok() instead of verify_ok(), since it is obsolete in 2.6.x kernel.

Ver 1.11.11 (12/08/2005)
1. new: Add npreal2 tools source code into the package.
2. bugfix: clean up data kept in internal buffer of Real TTY driver when the tty port is closed to prevent from receiving unexpected data in the following open.
3. bugfix: enlarge buffer size of ttyname[] array to prevent from invalid memory access error in the Linux distributions where long tty names are used.

Ver 1.11.9 (11/21/2005)
1. bugfix: Fixed compilation error on all v2.6.x versions.

4. new: Add debug print management.
5. bugfix: Incorrect working directory is returned when reading configuration file. Read configuration may fail.
6. bugfix: Alive check should verify both data channel and command channel to make disconnection timeout checking more accurate.

Ver 1.11.5 (9/13/2005)
1. bugfix: original put_to_user() declaration will cause type mismatch in 64-bit platform. Modify the delaration to make it work witn both 32-bit Linux and 64-bit Linux.

Ver 1.11.3 (9/5/2005)

2. Support Linux kernel version 2.4.x to 2.6.9.
3. Bug fixed: Warning message occurs with ppp dialout case.
4. Bug fixed: With kernel 2.4, try to ping a packet larger than 4KB via
              ppp dialout caused Linux to hang.

3. Add new product NPort 5110 into README.TXT and VERSION.TXT.
4. Fix bug: ap_id field is 4 byte long. Use ntohl() and htonl() to convert between host and network format.
