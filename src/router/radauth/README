wrt-radauth - Radius MAC authenticator for Broadcom based AccessPoints

This software watches the stations associating to a broadcom based
AccessPoint (e.g. Linksys WRT54G) and sends an authentication request
to the radius-server specified in nvram.
The following nvram-variables are used:

wl0_radius_ipaddr       IP-address of the radius-server
wl0_radius_port         UDP-port the radius-server listens on
wl0_radius_key          The shared radius-secret

When a station associates to the access-point, a radius access-request
with the following attributes is sent:
User-Name	MAC-address (see below)
User-Password	The shared secret
NAS-Port	1
NAS-Port-Type	0x13 (Wireless 802.11)

The MAC-address is sent either in the format aabbcc-ddeeff or
AA-BB-CC-DD-EE-FF, this can be changed with the -n commandline
option.

The wrt-radauth program is the wireless radius authenticator, the
radius-client program is a small test-program to check if
radius authentication works for a specified user/pass/server/secret
combination.

To compile the software, you need to modify the Makefile and set
the WRT_BUILDROOT variable to your buildroot.
