			ZEVIO utils installation
			========================

Requirements
------------

...

Installation
------------

For installation you can use these commands:

	./configure
	make install

If ./configure command complain that alsa-lib package isn't installed,
please, check if --prefix option is same for alsa-lib and alsa-utils
package. The configure script from alsa-utils package probably cannot find
header file asoundlib.h in $prefix/include/alsa directory (usually in
/usr/include/alsa directory).

Compilation from SVN sources
---------------------------

You need also GNU packages autoconf and automake installed in your system.

For compilation you can use these commands:

	aclocal
	autoheader
	automake --foreign --copy --add-missing
	autoconf
	./configure
	make

The included svncompile script does this job for you.

Note: Some automake packages have missing aclocal program. Use newer version
      in the case.
