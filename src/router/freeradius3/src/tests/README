  This is a preliminary test harness for the server.

$ make tests

	makes all of the tests

config/*

	virtual server configuration that is used for the tests

unit/*
	unit tests.  Mostly parsing tests, to see if we can parse
	conditions, xlat expansions, RADIUS attributes, etc.

xlat/*
	dynamic expansions.  All stand-alone ones.
	e.g. can we turn %{md5:fooo} into the MD5 hash?

keywords/*
	tests of "unlang" keywords.  Both parsing and functionality.

auth/*
	tests of authentication methods.

modules/*
	tests for individual modules

In general, just placing files of the correct format in a directory
will cause them to be picked up by the test harness.
