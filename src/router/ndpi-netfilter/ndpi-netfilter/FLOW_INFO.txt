		Collect and show NDPI flow info.

To activate the "flow info" need load a module with the parameter "ndpi_enable_flow=1".
Information about network traffic will be available in the /proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows file.
Data is collected only on the traffic that was selected by "-j NDPI --flow-info".
If you do not have such a rule, the file /proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows will always be empty!

The "-j NDPI --flow-info" rule can be used anywhere in the mangle and filter tables,
allowing you to flexibly choose the traffic that interests us.

An example for sample traffic passing only through a specific network
interface eth1 :

	iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m ndpi --all
	iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -m ndpi --all
	iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth1  -m ndpi ! --error -j NDPI --flow-info
	iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -m ndpi ! --error -j NDPI --flow-info

For information about traffic, you need to open the /proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows file
and read it to the end of the file.
( The process of reading data needs to be done as quickly as possible.
Not recommended to read by one the line. For a single read operation, 
you can get up to 256 KB of data. )


Example:

	cat /proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows

The first two lines of the data line may be special: 
"TIME xxxx" and "LOST_TRAFFIC x x x x"

"TIME xxxxx" - current system time (unix timestamp). This is the first
line when reading the beginning of the data.

"LOST_TRAFFIC x x x x" - summary information on lost traffic (see below).

Each line of connection information has 14 required fields and 5 additional fields:

1.  Connection start time.
2.  The time of the last connection packet.
3.  L3 proto: 4 - IPv4, 6 - IPv6
4.  L4 protocol (1 - icmp, 6 - tcp, 17 - udp ...)
5.  Source address
6.  Source port (0 if not exist)
7.  Destination address
8.  Destination port (0 if not exist)
9.  Bytes from sourse to destination
10. Bytes from destination to sourse
11. Packets from sourse to destination
12. Packets from destination to sourse
13. Interface indexes. Format: "I=<in_ifindex>,<out_ifindex>"
14. Connection mark. Optional. Format: "CM=<hexmark>"
15. Source NAT. Optional, only for IPv4. Format: "SN=ipv4_address:port"
16. Destination NAT. Optional, only for IPv4. Format: "DN=ipv4_address:port"
17. NDPI protocol. Format: "P=xxx"
18. NDPI hostname info. Optional. Only for DNS,HTTP. Format: "H=hostname"
19. NDPI SSL info. Optional. Only for SSL. Format: "C=cert_name"

We must read the file until we get an EOF. In the process of reading data, the
memory occupied by closed connections is released. If the number of records of
closed connections exceeds the limit, the memory occupied by this data will be
released and the next time the data is read, the first line will be
"LOST_TRAFFIC" with the total volume of traffic lost.

The limit can be set in two ways:
 1) module option ndpi_flow_limit=N
 2) echo "limit=N" >/proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows
 ( Information about one connection takes from 176 to 432 bytes )

To prevent memory overflow, there is one more parameter "timeout" - the
maximum time interval between reading data from the file /proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows
This parameter can be changed with the command "echo 330> /proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows"
If this interval is exceeded, then information about closing connections will
be deleted immediately.

We have three modes of reading traffic information:

 1) "read_all" (default mode) - reading all traffic information with zeroing counters.
 2) "read_closed" - reading data about closed connections. This is an auxiliary mode, 
    which is designed to work in systems with limited memory.
 3) "read_flows" - read all traffic information without resetting the counters (monitor mode).

You can change the reading mode with the command

echo "mode" >/proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows

Each time the /proc/net/xt_ndpi/flows file is opened, the read mode is reset to "read_all".
Changing the read mode can be done only if the current position is 0 or when
the EOF is reached.
