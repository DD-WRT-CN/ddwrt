Welcome to softflowd, a flow-based network monitor.

Introduction
------------

softflowd listens promiscuously on a network interface and semi-statefully
tracks network flows. These flows can be reported using NetFlow version 1, 5 
or 9 datagrams. softflowd is fully IPv6 capable: it can track IPv6 flows and 
export to IPv6 hosts.

More details about softflowd's function and usage may be found in the
supplied manpages, which you can view prior to installation using

/usr/bin/nroff -c -mandoc softflowd.8 | less
/usr/bin/nroff -c -mandoc softflowctl.8 | less

If you are in need of a NetFlow collector, you may be interested in 
softflowd's companion project "flowd" (http://www.mindrot.org/flowd.html). 
flowd is a NetFlow collector that is maintained in parallel with
softflowd and includes a few handy features, such as the ability
to filter flows it receives as well as Perl and Python APIs to its
storage format. NB. You don't have to use flowd: any NetFlow compatible 
collector should work with softflowd. An example Perl collector is included 
for testing purposes as collector.pl, but it doesn't yet support NetFlow v.9

Installing
----------

Building softflowd should be as simple as typing:

./configure
make
make install

Unfortunately some systems like to make life complicated. Things work
fine on the systems that I develop and test on (OpenBSD and Linux).
There is peliminary support for Solaris 9 (i.e. it compiled), but no
testing on this platform has been performed.
