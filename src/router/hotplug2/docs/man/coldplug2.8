.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The coldplug2 application recursively scans /sys for 'uevent' files and sends 'add' event. Kernel then sends the event using netlink socket to hotplug2 that processes the event.
.PP 
It is also possible to specify list of directories, such as 'bus/pci' and 'block', to only limit scanning to these subdirectories. Note that symlinks are not followed.

.SH "NOTES"

There is no check for valid directories passed as arguments. If you specify '../', the root fs will be scanned.
