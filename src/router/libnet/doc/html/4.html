<br><a NAME="s4.1"></a><b><font size=+2>4.1 The Order of Operations</font></b>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>In order to build and inject an arbitrary network packet,
there is a standard order of operations to be followed.&nbsp; There are
five easy steps to packet injection happiness:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<font size=-1>Memory Initialization</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Network Initialization</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Packet Construction</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Packet Checksums</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Packet Injection</font></li>
</ol>
<font size=-1>Each one of these is an important topic and is covered below.</font>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><a NAME="s4.1.1"></a><b><font size=+2>4.1.1 Memory Allocation and Initialization</font></b>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>The first step in employing libnet in your application
is to allocate memory for a packet.&nbsp; The conventional way to do this
is via a call to libnet_init_packet().&nbsp; You just need to make sure
you specify enough memory for whatever packet you're going to build.&nbsp;
This will also require some forethought as to which injection method you're
going to use (see below for more information).&nbsp; If you're going to
build a simple TCP packet (sans options) with a 30 byte payload using the
IP-layer interface, you'll need 70 bytes (IP header + TCP header + payload).&nbsp;
If you're going to build the same packet using the link-layer interface,
you'll need 84 bytes (ethernet header + IP header + TCP header + payload).&nbsp;
To be safe you could just allocate IP_MAXPACKET + ETH_H bytes (65549) and
not worry about overwriting buffer boundaries.&nbsp; When finished with
the memory, it should be released with a call to libnet_destroy_packet()
(this can either be in a garbage collection function or at the end of the
program).</font>
<p><font size=-1>Another method of memory allocation is via the arena interface.&nbsp;
Arenas are basically memory pools that allocate large chunks of memory
in one call, divvy out chunks as needed, then deallocate the whole pool
when done.&nbsp; The libnet arena interface is useful when you want to
preload different kinds of packets that you're potentially going to be
writing in rapid succession.&nbsp; It is initialized with a call to libnet_init_packet_arena()
and chunks are retrieved with libnet_next_packet_from_arena().&nbsp; When
finished with the memory it should be released with a call to libnet_destroy_packet_arena()
(this can either be in a garbage collection function or at the end of the
program).</font>
<p><font size=-1>An important note regarding memory management and packet
construction:&nbsp; If you do not allocate enough memory for the type of
packet you're building, your program will probably segfault on you.&nbsp;
Libnet can detect when you haven't passed <i>any</i> memory, but not when
you haven't passed enough.&nbsp; Take heed.</font>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><a NAME="s4.1.2"></a><b><font size=+2>4.1.2 Network Initialization</font></b>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>The next step is to bring up the network injection interface.&nbsp;
With the IP-layer interface, this is with a call to libnet_open_raw_sock()
with the appropriate protocol (usually IPPROTO_RAW).&nbsp; This call will
return a raw socket with IP_HDRINCL set on the socket telling the kernel
you're going to build the IP header.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The link-layer interface is brought up with a call to
libnet_open_link_interface() with the proper device argument.&nbsp; This
will return a pointer to a ready to go link interface structure.</font>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><a NAME="s4.1.3"></a><b><font size=+2>4.1.3 Packet Construction</font></b>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>Packets are constructed modularly.&nbsp; For each protocol
layer, there should be a corresponding call to a libnet_build function.&nbsp;
Depending on your end goal, different things may happen here.&nbsp; For
the above IP-layer example, calls to libnet_build_ip() and libnet_build_tcp()
will be made.&nbsp; For the link-layer example, an additional call to libnet_build_ethernet()
will be made.&nbsp; It is important to note that the ordering of the packet
constructor function calls is not significant, it is only necessary that
the correct memory locations be passed to these functions.&nbsp; The functions
need to build the packet headers inside the buffer as they would appear
on the wire and be demultiplexed by the recipient, and this can be done
in any order (figure 2).</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="figure-2.gif" ALT="figure 2" height=642 width=507 align=TEXTTOP></center>
<font size=-1>libnet_build_ethernet() would be passed the beginning of
the buffer with an offset of 0 (as it needs to build an ethernet header
at the front of the packet).&nbsp; libnet_build_ip() would get the buffer
at a 14 byte (ETH_H) offset to construct the IP header in the correct location,
while libnet_build_tcp() would get the buffer 20 bytes beyond this (or
at a 34 bytes offset from the beginning (ETH_H + IP_H)).&nbsp; This is
easily apparent in the <a href="7.html">example code</a>.</font>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><a NAME="s4.1.4"></a><b><font size=+2>4.1.4 Packet Checksums</font></b>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>The next-to-last step is computing the packet checksums
(assuming the packet is an IP packet of some sort).&nbsp; For the raw IP
interface, we need only compute a transport layer checksum (assuming our
packet has a transport layer protocol) as the kernel will handle our IP
checksum.&nbsp; For the link-layer interface, the IP checksum must be explicitly
computed.&nbsp; Checksums are calculated via libnet_do_checksum(), which
will be expecting the buffer passed to point to the IP header of the packet.</font>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><a NAME="s4.1.5"></a><b><font size=+2>4.1.5 Packet Injection</font></b>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>The last step is to write the packet to the network.&nbsp;
Using the IP-layer interface this is accomplished with libnet_write_ip(),
and with the link-layer interface it is accomplished with libnet_write_link_layer().&nbsp;
The functions return the number of bytes written (which should jive with
the size of your packet) or a -1 on error.</font>

<br><a NAME="s4.2"></a><b><font size=+2>4.2 Using the Configure Script</font></b>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>There has been some confusion on how to correctly implement
the libnet-configure shell script.&nbsp; Since 0.99e, it has become mandatory
to use this script.&nbsp; The library will not compile code without it.&nbsp;
This is to avoid potential problems when user code is compiled with improper
or missing CPP macros.&nbsp; The script also has provisions for specifying
libraries and cflags.&nbsp; The library switch is useful on architectures
that require additional libraries to compile network code (such as Solaris).&nbsp;
The script is very simple to use.&nbsp; The following examples should dispell
any confusion:</font>

<font size=-1>&nbsp;At the command line you can run the script to see what

<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>People often wonder when to use the link-layer interface
in place of the IP-layer interface.&nbsp; It's mainly trading of power
and complexity for ease of use.&nbsp; The link-layer interface is slightly
more complex and requires a bit more coding.&nbsp; A standard invocation
of either interface might include the following:</font>

<font size=-1>The link-layer interface is also considerably more powerful
and portable (if you want to build ARP/RARP/ethernet frames it's the only
way to go) than the raw IP interface (see below).</font>
<p><font size=-1>One major issue with the link-layer interface, however,
is that in order to send packets to arbitrary remote Internet hosts, it
needs to know the MAC address of the first hop router.&nbsp; This is accomplished
via ARP packets, but if proxy ARP isn't being done, you run into all kinds
of problems determining whose MAC address to request.&nbsp; Code to portably
alleviate this problem is being developed.</font>

<br><a NAME="s4.4"></a><b><font size=+2>4.4 Spoofing Ethernet Addresses</font></b>
<br>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="97%">
<br><font size=-1>Certain operating systems (specifically ones that use
the Berkeley Packet Filter for link-layer access) do not allow for arbitrary
specification of source ethernet addresses.&nbsp; This is not so much a
bug as it is an oversight in the protocol.&nbsp; The way around this is
to patch the kernel.&nbsp; There are two ways to patch a kernel, either
statically, with kernel diffs (which requires the individual to have the
kernel sources, and know how to rebuild and install a new kernel) or dynamically,
with loadable kernel modules (lkms).&nbsp; Since it's a bit overzealous
to assume people will want to patch their kernel for a library, included
with the libnet distribution is lkm code to seamlessly bypass the bpf restriction.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In order to spoof ethernet packets on bpf-based systems
(currently supported are FreeBSD and OpenBSD) do the following: cd to the
proper support/bpf-lkm/ directory, build the module, and modload it.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The module works as per the following description:</font>
<p><font size=-1>The 4.4BSD machine-independent ethernet driver does not
allow upper layers to forge the ethernet source address; all ethernet outputs
cause the output routine to build a new ethernet header, and the process
that does this explicitly copies the MAC address registered to the interface
into this header.</font>
<p><font size=-1>This is odd, because the bpf writing convention asserts
that writes to bpf must include a link-layer header; it's intuitive to
assume that this header is, along with the rest of the packet data, written
to the wire.</font>
<p><font size=-1>This is not the case. The link-layer header is used solely
by the bpf code in order to build a sockaddr structure that is passed to
the generic ethernet output routine; the header is then effectively stripped
off the</font>
<br><font size=-1>packet. The ethernet output routine consults this sockaddr
to obtain the ethernet type and destination address, but not the source
address.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The Libnet lkm simply replaces the standard ethernet output
routine with a slightly modified one.&nbsp; This modified version retrieves
the source ethernet address from the sockaddr and uses it as the source
address for the header written the wire. This allows bpf to be used to
seamlessly forge ethernet packets in their entirety, which has applications
in address management.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The modload glue provided traverses the global list of
system interfaces, and replaces any pointer to the original ethernet output
routine with the new one we've provided. The unload glue undoes this. The
effect of loading this module will be that all ethernet interfaces on the
system will support source address forging.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Thomas H. Ptacek wrote the first version of this lkm in
1997.</font>

platforms.</font>
