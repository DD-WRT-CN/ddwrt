<br><b><font size=+2>1. Introduction</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>Libnet is a C library providing a high-level interface
to packet injection primitives across many platforms.&nbsp; Previous to
libnet, programmers had to wrestle with confusing, obscure, and poorly
documented interfaces to build and write network packets.&nbsp; Libnet
alleviates these problems and provides a well documented, simple API to
quickly build portable programs that write network packets (figure 1).</font>

<p><font size=-1>Libnet was written for two main reasons:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1>To establish a simple interface by which network programmers
could ignore the subtleties and nuances of low-level network programming
(and therefore concentrate on writing their programs and solving their
problems).</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>To mitigate the irritation many network programmers experienced
due to the lack of standards.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=-1>To be honest, I can't believe someone didn't write something
like libnet (also termed "libpwrite") a long time ago.&nbsp; It seemed
like such an obvious gap that needed to be filled.&nbsp; I was sure the
<a href="http://ee.lbl.gov">LBNL</a>
guys (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory -- they wrote <a href="http://ee.lbl.gov">libpcap[1</a><a href="7.html">]</a>)
would put something together.&nbsp; Libnet, on a high level, is the packet
injector analog to libpcap.&nbsp; They are brothers (or sisters).</font>
<p><font size=-1>Libnet is a wonderful utility for writing security-related
applications, tools and modules.&nbsp; Many recent exploits have been rapidly
developed using libnet as have many security related tools.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.packetfactory.net">Packetfactory</a>
has many such examples.</font>
<p><font size=-1>This manual describes libnet in detail, including library
internals and design decisions, as well as including step by step coding
examples.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The primary author of libnet is Mike D. Schiffman &lt;mike@infonexus.com>.&nbsp;
However, libnet just wouldn't be libnet without the teeming masses of
<a href="contrib.html">other
way talented people</a> who have helped out.</font>
