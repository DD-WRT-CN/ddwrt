    All legacy applications written on top of libnet that have NOT been
    modified to make use of the libnet-config script will fail.  This is
    because as of version 0.99e libnet needs to have an endian-ness defined
    (handled by the script).  You'll know you have this problem if you see an
    error like:

/usr/include/libnet.h:89: #error "byte order has not been specified, you'll
need to #define either LIBNET_LIL_ENDIAN or LIBNET_BIG_ENDIAN.  See the
documentation regarding the libnet-config script."

    To remedy this, add to your Makefile something like:

DEFINES     =  `libnet-config --defines` <OTHER_DEFINES_HERE...>

    Or, if you're compiling at the command line, simply do something like:

host:~> gcc -Wall `libnet-config --defines` foo.c `libnet-config --libs`

    For more information on the libnet-config script, see README.libnet-config.

    Also, by version 1.0, expect support for the older style naming
    nomenclature to be removed.
