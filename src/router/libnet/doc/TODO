    - By version 1.0 the old naming convention will be completely removed.
      Take heed!

    - Architectures such as Solaris have strict alignment requirements.  TCP
      and IP option insertion code seem to break there.  Fix that.

    - Make .so's

    - Add build_rpc()

    - Add IPv6 functionality
