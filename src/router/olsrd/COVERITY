Building for a Coverity scan:


Setting up you build tooling:
=============================
1. Go to http://scan.coverity.com/self-build/ and follow the 'Do once'
   instructions.
     1. Download and extract the tarball relevant to your system.
     2. Add the (extracted) bin directory to your path


Building:
=========
Make sure to be in the directory of the source tree (we assume a git checkout
in this description), and run the following commands:
     ccache -C
     git clean -fdx
     git reset --hard
     cov-build --dir cov-int make DESTDIR="$(pwd)/dist" build_all install_all
     tar czf "$(pwd)/dist/olsr.tgz" cov-int

Lookup the following data:
     1. the (Coverity) project USERNAME
     2. the (Coverity) project PASSWORD
     3. your EMAIL address on which you want to receive an analysis confirmation

Now upload the build (you will need the project USERNAME and PASSWORD for this):
     curl --form file="@$(pwd)/dist/olsr.tgz" \
          --form project=USERNAME \
          --form password=PASSWORD \
          --form email=EMAIL \
