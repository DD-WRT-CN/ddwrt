HTTP MINI-SERVER PLUGIN FOR OLSRD 0.1
by Andreas Tonnesen(andreto@olsr.org)

-----------------------------------------------------

 ABOUT

This plugin implements a tiny HTTP server that will respond to a GET request
by returning a HTML formatted page containing information about the currently
running olsrd process.

This information includes detailed link status for all links and neighbors, all
olsrd routes in the kernel, local configuration, uptime and more. The plugin
can also generate an olsrd configfile based on current running configuration.

In adittion an experimental administrtion interface is available.

-----------------------------------------------------

Remember to open the port in your firewall if planning to access the HTTP
server from a remote host!

LoadPlugin "olsrd_httpinfo.so.0.1"
{
    # The port number on which the plugin will be listening
    # PlParam     "port"               "1978"

    # IP addresses that can access the plugin, use "0.0.0.0" to allow everyone
    # Access is always allowed from localhost (127.0.0.1).
    # PlParam     "host"               "127.0.0.1"
    # PlParam     "host"               "80.23.53.22"

    # Networks that can access the plugin (ip/netmask), use 0.0.0.0/0 to allow
    # everyone.
    # Access is always allowed from localhost (127.0.0.1).
    # PlParam     "net"                "0.0.0.0/0"
    # PlParam     "net"                "104.0.0.0/16"
    # PlParam     "net"                "192.168.0.0/16"

    # Set to true to resolve host names
    # PlParam     "resolve"            "false"
}

 EXPERIMENTAL ADMIN INTERFACE

The plugin can be compiled with a experimental administrator interface. This
is a web page that will let the user change olsrd settings in real-time.

To compile with this feature pass ADMIN_INTERFACE=1 as an argument to make
(eg. make ADMIN_INTERFACE=1)

-----------------------------------------------------

NOTE!
This plugin is very olsrd version sensitive. This means that to be sure
everything works as it is supposed to you should use the version of olsrd that
the plugin was shipped with. If using CVS you should check out/update both
olsrd and this plugin.

The plugin should now compile on windows and FreeBSD as well.

To compile in windows:
  make OS=win32
To compile in FreeBSD:
  gmake OS=fbsd

Installation:
make
make install
