============
INTRODUCTION
============

The poprouting plugin is not an info plugin, but it uses the info structure to allow communication.
It is used to set the values of the Hello and the TC timers/multiplier in olsrd.
It can be also used to get the current values from the daemon.

Please first read what's written in the file lib/info/README_INFO.


==================
SUPPORTED COMMANDS
==================
The commands can be specified with or without a float number after the =.
In the former case the timer or the multiplier will be set at that specific value.
In the latter case the plugin will return the actual value for that timer or multiplier.

* /helloTimer=%f
* /TCTimer=%f
* /helloTimerMult=%f
* /TCTimerMult=%f
* /helloTimer
* /TCTimer
* /helloTimerMult
