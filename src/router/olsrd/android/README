Building olsrd for Android
--------------------------

Currently the makefiles are setup for NDK r10.

In order to build olsrd and the plugins for Android, you will need to
download the free (as in beer, and mostly as in speech) Android NDK.

http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

Once you have that installed, run this in your terminal:

  make OS=android NDK_BASE=/path/to/your/android-ndk build_all

Then you can find olsrd in the root, and the plugin files in lib/*/*.so*

If using a different NDK then you will need to adjust the NDK_COMPILER_VERSION
setting in the file

  make/Makefile.android.compiler

or (preferably) by setting it on the make command-line invocation, like

  make OS=android NDK_BASE=/path/to/your/android-ndk-r7 \
       NDK_COMPILER_VERSION=4.4.3 build_all


Android App
-----------

As part of the Commotion project, there is an Android app being
developed to make it easy to install and run OLSR mesh networking on
Android devices.  This app is called Commotion Mesh Tether:
