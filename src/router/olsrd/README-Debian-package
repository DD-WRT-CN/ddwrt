If you want to build the Debian packages from the latest git source, here is
how to do it:

First, get the latest debian/ folder from Subversion, which contains all the
files needed to build the Debian package, then run dpkg-buildpackage:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential dpkg-dev
  git clone https://github.com/OLSR/olsrd.git
  cd olsrd
  svn checkout svn://svn.debian.org/svn/collab-maint/deb-maint/olsrd/trunk/debian
  echo "1.0" > debian/source/format
  dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
  ls -l ../olsrd*.*

If you want the package to have the proper version, then you'll need to edit
the debian/changelog file.  Just change the version number on the top-most
line of debian/changelog.

You can also find the latest tarballs of the debian/ folder here, look on the
right column under "Download Source Package olsrd":
http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/olsrd

e.g.
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/o/olsrd/olsrd_0.6.3-6.debian.tar.gz

You can find complete developer info here:
