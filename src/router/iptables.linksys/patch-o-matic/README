IMPORTANT NOTE: This version _only_ supports kernel >= 2.4.18

README:
   This is the patch-o-matic distribution by the netfilter project
   (http://www.netfilter.org/)

   As of iptables-1.2.7, patch-o-matic is distributed as a seperate
   package, available from ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/patch-o-matic.

================================================================

FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

0) There may be some outstanding bugfixes or tweaks which are not yet
   in the official kernel.  To look through these, do:
	# KERNEL_DIR=<<where-you-built-your-kernel>>  ./runme pending

   Please note that you have to recompile your kernel and your kernel modules
   after this step of kernel patching.

That's it!
================================================================

FEELING BRAVE?

1) The netfilter core team is maintaining a set of extensions / new 
   features which are not yet committed to the mainstream kernel tree.

They are a collection of maybe-broken maybe-cool third-party extensions. 

Please note that you cannot apply any combination of any of those patches.
Some of them are incompatible... 

This is why we provide two ways of applying them:

If you want to try some extensions, and be sure that they don't break each
other, you can do the following:

	# KERNEL_DIR=<<where-you-built-your-kernel>>  ./runme base

It will modify you kernel source (so back it up first!).  You will have
to recompile / rebuild your kernel and modules.

Alternatively, if you really know what your are doing, you can use the
following command in order to offer you the full list of choices.  Be aware
that we don't prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot.

	% KERNEL_DIR=<<where-you-built-your-kernel>>  ./runme extra
