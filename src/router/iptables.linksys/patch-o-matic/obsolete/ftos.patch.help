Status: Obsoleted by new DSCP and ECN targets

This adds CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_FTOS option, which allows setting the
TOS field within the packet to any value between 0x0 and 0xff. This
includes all legal TOS values. It does not take account of the DiffServ
split of the field nor does it account for the ECN bit states.

Basically you can set the TOS field to whatever value you want.
