Attached patch adds FXP support to ftp connectiontracking. FXP'ing to NAT'ed 
ftp daemons does not work yet. 

Load ip_conntrack_ftp.o with modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp fxp=1 to enable FXP
functionality to connectiontracking of ftpsessions.

WARNING: Applying this patch and enabling the feature _WILL_ reduce security
	 offered by FTP connection tracking significantly.  Use with extreme
	 care - and only if you know what you are doing.
