TFTP connections will not work with NAT and this module makes
that work.

modprobe ip_conntrack_tftp ports=69,70 has the effect of
helping tftp connections on port 69 and 70.
If the ports argument is not supplied to modprobe it defaults
to 69.

If you have trouble please drop me a mail and I will help you.
