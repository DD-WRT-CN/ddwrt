This adds CONFIG_IP_NF_CTNETLINK option, which enables connection
tracking via NETLINK. Netfilter has the ability to communicate connection 
tracking information to user space. This feature allows the user to
receive connection tracking event notification and provides the
ability to change connection states from user space.

Please not that this is an experimental package which will break other 
patch-o-matic patches
