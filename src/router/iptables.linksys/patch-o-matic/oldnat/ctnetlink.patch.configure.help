IP: conntection tracking via NETLINK (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP_NF_CTNETLINK
  Netfilter has the ability to communicate connection tracking
  information to user space. This feature allows the user to
  receive connection tracking event notification and provides the
  ability to change connection states from user space.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
