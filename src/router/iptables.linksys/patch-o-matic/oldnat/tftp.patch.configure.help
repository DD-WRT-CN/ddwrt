CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP
TFTP protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TFTP
  TFTP connection tracking helper, this is required depending
  on how restrictive your ruleset is.
  If you are using a tftp client behind -j SNAT or -j MASQUERADING
  you will need this.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `Y'.
