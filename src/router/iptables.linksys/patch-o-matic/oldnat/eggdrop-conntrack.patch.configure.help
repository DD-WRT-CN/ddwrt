CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP
Eggdrop bot support
CONFIG_IP_NF_EGG
  If you are running an eggdrop hub bot on this machine, then you
  may want to enable this feature. This enables eggdrop bots to share
  their user file to other eggdrop bots.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
