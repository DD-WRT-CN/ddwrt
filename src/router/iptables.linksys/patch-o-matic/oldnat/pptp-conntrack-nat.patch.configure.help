PPTP conntrack and NAT support
CONFIG_IP_NF_PPTP
  If you are running PPTP sessions over a stateful firewall or NAT box,
  you may want to enable this feature.  It enables conntrack and NAT for
  PPTP sessions.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
