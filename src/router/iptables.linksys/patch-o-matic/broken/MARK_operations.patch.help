This patch adds support for setting the nfmark bitwise (and & or).

# iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p icmp -j MARK --or-mark 0x15
# iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p icmp -j MARK --and-mark 0x15

***** WARNING ***** This patch also patch the userspace directory which means that you
                    you have to recompile and reinstall the iptables package after that.
