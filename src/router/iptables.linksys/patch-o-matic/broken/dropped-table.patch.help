Status: Beta, redesign underway, applies now to 2.4.4-final

This patch adds a `drop' table to iptables, adding a
CONFIG_IP_NF_DROPTABLE option.  Packets which are going to be dropped
by the NAT or routing code (among others) will traverse this table,
allowing them to be logged.

THIS PATCH WILL BREAK OTHER PATCHES (irc-conntrack-nat,talk,NETMAP,SAME,...)
