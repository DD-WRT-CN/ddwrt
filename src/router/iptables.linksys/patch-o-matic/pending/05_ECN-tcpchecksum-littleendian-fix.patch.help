Status: Pending for kernel inclusion

The 2.4.20 kernel included the new iptables 'ECN' target, enabling a selective
ECN disable mechanism.   Unfortunately there was a bug in the incremental TCP
checksum update, resulting in broken TCP checksums on little endian machines.

This patch fixes the Bug.
