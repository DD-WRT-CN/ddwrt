CONFIG_IP_NF_IRC
Quake III Arena protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_QUAKE3
  Quake III Arena  connection tracking helper. This module allows for a
  stricter firewall rulebase if one only allows traffic to a master
  server. Connections to Quake III server IP addresses and ports returned
  by the master server will be tracked automatically.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `Y'.
