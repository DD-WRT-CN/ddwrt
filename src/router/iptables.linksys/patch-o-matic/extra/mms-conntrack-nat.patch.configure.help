MMS protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MMS
  Tracking MMS (Microsoft Windows Media Services) connections
  could be problematic if random ports are used to send the
  streaming content. This option allows users to track streaming
  connections over random UDP or TCP ports.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `Y'.
