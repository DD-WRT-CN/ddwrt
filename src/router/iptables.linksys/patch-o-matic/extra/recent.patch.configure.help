CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
recent match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_RECENT
  This option allows you to create lists of recently seen source
  addresses and then match against that list based on number of
  times seen and the time since last seen.  An option is also
  availible to require a match against TTL in addition to source
  address.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
