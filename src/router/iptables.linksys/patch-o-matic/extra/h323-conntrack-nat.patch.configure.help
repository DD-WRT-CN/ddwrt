H.323 (netmeeting) support
CONFIG_IP_NF_H323
  H.323 is a standard signalling protocol used by teleconferencing
  softwares like netmeeting. With the ip_conntrack_h323 and
  the ip_nat_h323 modules you can support the protocol on a connection
  tracking/NATing firewall.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say 'M' here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say 'N'.
