Status: Under development, but stabilizing now.

I've finally managed to get the redesign of nfnetlink/ctnetlink done.
There is now the testing version 0.11 in patch-o-matic, it can be found
at patch-o-matic/extra/nfnetlink-ctnetlink.patch. 
										The next step will be the new iptables kernel<->userspace interface based on
nfnetlink, I'll be concentrating on this during the next week(s).
