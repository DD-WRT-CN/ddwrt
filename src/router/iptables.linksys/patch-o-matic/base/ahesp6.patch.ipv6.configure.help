CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_MAC
AH/ESP match support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_AHESP
  These two match extensions (`ah' and `esp') allow you to match a
  range of SPIs inside AH or ESP headers of IPv6 packets.
 
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
