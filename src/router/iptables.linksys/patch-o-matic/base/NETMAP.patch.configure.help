NETMAP target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_NETMAP
  NETMAP is an implementation of static 1:1 NAT mapping of network
  addresses. It maps the network address part, while keeping the
  host address part intact. It is similar to Fast NAT, except that
  Netfilter's connection tracking doesn't work well with Fast NAT.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  The module will be called
  ipt_NETMAP.o.  If unsure, say `N'.
