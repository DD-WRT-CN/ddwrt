CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT
SAME NAT target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_SAME
  This option adds a `SAME' target, which works like the standard
  SNAT target, but attempts to give clients the same IP for all
  connections.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  The module will be called
  ipt_SAME.o.  If unsure, say `N'.
