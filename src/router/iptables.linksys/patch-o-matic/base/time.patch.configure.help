CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
TIME patch support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TIME
  This option adds a `time' match, which allows you
  to matchbased on the packet arrival time
  (arrival time at the machine which the netfilter is running on) or
  departure time (for locally generated packets).

  If you say Y here, try iptables -m time --help for more information.
 
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
