CONFIG_IP6_NF_FILTER
REJECT target support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_TARGET_REJECT
  The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMPv6
  error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather
  than silently being dropped.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
