CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
IPV4OPTIONS patch support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_IPV4OPTIONS
  This option adds a IPV4OPTIONS match.
  It allows you to filter options like source routing,
  record route, timestamp and router-altert.

  If you say Y here, try iptables -m ipv4options --help for more information.
 
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
