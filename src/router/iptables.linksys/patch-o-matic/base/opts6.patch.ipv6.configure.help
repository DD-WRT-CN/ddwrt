CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_MAC
Fragmentation header match support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_OPTS
  These match extensions (`hbh' and `dst') allow you to select the packet 
  based on the fileds of the option header of the IPv6 packets.
 
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
