CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE
Connections/IP limit match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_IPLIMIT
  This match allows you to restrict the number of parallel TCP
  connections to a server per client IP address (or address block).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
