CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
REALM match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_REALM
  This option adds a `realm' match, which allows you to use the realm
  key from the routing subsytem inside iptables.

  This match pretty much resembles the CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE4 option 
  in tc world.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
