Status: Under development , but works .

This option adds CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_FUZZY,
which allows you to match packets according to a dynamic profile
implemented by means of a simple Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) .

Suppported options are:

--upper-limit => Desired upper bound for traffic rate

--lower-limit => Lower bound over which the FLC starts to limit traffic
