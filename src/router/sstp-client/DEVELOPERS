Patches

You may send patches by e-mail, direct or to the mailing list, or if
you have SVN commit rights, you may use them.

Developers have permission (and encouragement) to adjust more than the
file that they are submitting.  Other files that may be adjusted are:

ChangeLog
	documentation of changes at the code level.

NEWS
	a history of changes as far as an end user is concerned.

AUTHORS
	a list of people who want credit for contributions.

TODO
	a list of things yet to be done.

See section two of Eric Raymond's Software Release Practice HOWTO for
some useful information on good patching practice.
