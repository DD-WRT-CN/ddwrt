Usage Notes

The sstpc binary can be started in a various number of ways as listed below:
 * Pseudo-TTY child process 
 * Use sstpc to start pppd

You will need to setup provider file for your connection that provides the 
most common options and store this file in /etc/ppp/peers/<provider>:

remotename	<provider>		# Used in ip up/down scripts
linkname	<provider>		# Used in ip up/down scripts
ipparam		<provider>		# Used in ip up/down scripts
name		<DOMAIN\\USER>		# Specifies the DOMAIN and USER
plugin		sstp-pppd-plugin.so	# REQUIRED (SSTP)
sstp-sock	/var/run/sstpc/sstp-uds-sock # REQUIRED (SSTP)
usepeerdns				# Use the peer dns addresses
require-mppe				# REQUIRED (MPPE)
noauth					# We don't need the server to auth itself
require-mschap-v2			# MSCHAPv2 Authentication Support
refuse-eap				# Not yet supported
refuse-chap				# Don't accept CHAP-MD5
refuse-mschap				# Don't accept MSCHAP
lock					# Lock the port
nsbsdcomp				# Turn off compression protocols
nodeflate				# Turn off compression protocols

You can use the above example to setup a SSTP connection using sstpc. You can
either add the pty option to this file, or execute it by command line:

   pppd call <provider> \
	pty "/usr/sbin/sstpc [<sstp-opts>] server --nolaunchpppd"

Or you can have sstpc launch it directly using the following command line:
   sstpc [<sstp-opts>] <server> \
	call <provider>

If your require not to compile/run with the PPP plugin support, there is an 
alternative to invoke the sstpc application specifying the username and the
password on command line too.

   sstpc --user <DOMAIN\\USER> --password <PASS> [<sstp-opts>] server \
	call <provider>

Then remove the 'plugin' and 'sstp-sock' options in the provider file.

Two examples have been included in the support directory: 
 - peer-example-sstp-test-nopty
 - peer-example-sstp-test

Additionally, there's sstp-test example files put into your documentation 
directory. Dependent on your installation, that should be in the following
location: /usr/share/doc/sstp-client


NOTE THAT PPTP MUST BE RUN AS ROOT for the first two venues of invoking the 
sstpc application. This is because of the plugin option.  If you chose not
to specify the user/password on command line, then you need to make sure 
your user have an appropriate entry in the /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file.
