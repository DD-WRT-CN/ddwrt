0. The following files are included:
  a) The server CA for the SSTP-TEST domain
     SSTP-TEST-N3ZZ-DC1-CA.PEM (X509)
  b) The server certificate  
     N3ZZ-DC1-SSTP-TEST-NET.PEM (X509)
  c) The server certificate private key
     N3ZZ-DC1-SSTP-TEST-NET.KEY (PEM)

1. Configure Windows 2008 R2 Server with
  a) A domain controller
  b) Certificate service
  b) RAS VPN + SSTP

2. Generate the server certificate based on the trusted CA for the A/D
  a) Use the Certificate snap-in with the 'mmc.exe', 
    - All Tasks -> Create new certificate request
    - Select a template based on Client and Server Authentication.
    - Make sure you edit the template before creating the 
      cert, allow export of private keys
    - CN must have the domain you anticipate to use for your server
    - Create the certificate
  b) Right click on certificate, click export
  c) Export as PKCS#12, save keys to a location on disk; e.g. c:\sstp-keys.pfx

3. Use openssl to convert the keys into a non-encrypted RSA file
    Example:
      openssl pkcs12 -in sstp--keys.pfx -out sstp-rsa.pem -nodes

4. Open Wireshark
   a) Edit Preferences (Edit->Preferences)
   b) Unfold the protocol list, locate SSL
   c) In the textbox for RSA keys List, enter: <ipaddr>,<port>,https,/path/to/sstp-rsa.pem
   d) Optionally, you can allow SSL debug file to be redirected to a file of your choice.

5. There is not much to the HTTP headers for the SSTP protocol but the 
   initial HTTP handshake.
