NEWS for version 2.2.x                                             -*-text-*-

Interpreter Enhancements
========================

   1.  The ternary expression was added:

           expression = condition ? val1 : val2

       If condition is non-zero, then expression = val1,
        otherwise expression = val2

   2.  The break and condition statements support an optional integer
       that indicates how many loop levels the statement affects, e.g.,
       the break statement in

           while (1)
	     {
	         loop (10)
		    {
		        break 2;
		    }
	     }

       will cause both loops to be terminated.

   3.  Multiline strings have been added:

           "This is a \
	    multiline \
	    string"

           `This is
	    another multiline
	    string that
	    does not require
	    a \ for continuation`

    4.  List_Type objects may be indexed using an array of indices
        instead of just a single scalar index.

    5.  (v2.2.3) Binary literal integers of the form 0bxx...x are supported.
        Here, x is 0 or 1.  The printf "%B" format specifier was added
	to format integers as binary.

    6.  (v2.2.3) The dereference operator (@) may be used in a structure
        definition to include the fields from the dereferenced
	structure, e.g.,

	  space = struct {x, y, z};
	  spacetime = struct {@space, t};

    7.  (v2.2.3) Dereferencing a scalar or vector class type now
       results in duplication of the object, e.g, @7 will produce 7.

    8.  (v2.2.3) Mergesort was made the default sorting algorithm.  See the
        array_sort for details.

Modules
=======

   1.  zlib: A module that wraps the popular z compression library.

   2.  fork: A module that wraps the fork, exec*, and waitpid functions.

         slsh/lib/process.sl utilizes this module to allow an
	 application to easily create subprocesses and pipelines.

   3.  sysconf: Module that implements interfaces to the posix
       sysconf, pathconf, etc. functions.

   4.  (2.2.3) csv: A module that supports the reading and writing of
       so-called Comma Separated Values files.

NEWS for version 2.1

Building the library
====================

   `make install' installs the shared version of the library.
   Previously `make install' installed just the static version and a
   separate step (`make install-elf') was required to install the
   shared version.  Now, `make install-static' is necessary to install
   the static one.

Interpreter News
=================

Syntax enhancements:
--------------------

   1.  Short circuiting boolean operators:

           if ((x == y) || (y == 3) && (x != 4)) ...

       (orelse and andelse are deprecated)

   2.  Structure definitions allow embdedded assignment expressions:

           s = struct {x = 3, name="foo", a = [1:10]};

   3.  Qualifiers (aka "keywords") added to the language:

           save_file ("foo.c"; overwrite=1);
	   plot_points ([1:10], sin([1:10]); color="red", style="solid");

   3.  Expressions such as (a < b < c) now interpreted to mean
       (a<b)and(b<c).

   4.  New keywords: ifnot, then

       ifnot may be used instead of !if, which has been deprecated.
       For "then" see the next item.

   5.  Looping constructs support a "then" clause that will get
       executed if the loop runs to completion, e.g.,

           loop (20)
	    {
	       if (this ())
	         break;  % The then clause will NOT get executed
	    }
	   then do_that ();

   6.  A floating point array of exactly N elements may be created
       using the form [a:b:#N], where the elements are uniformly
       spaced and run from a to b, inclusive.

   7.  References to array elements and structure fields are
       supported, e.g., &A[3], &s.foo.

   8.  An exception may be rethrown by calling "throw" without any
       arguments:

           try { something (); }
	   catch AnyError: { do_this (); throw; }

New Intrinsic Functions:
------------------------

   wherenot(x) :
              Equivalent to where (not(x))

   _$(str) :
              Evaluates strings with embedded "dollar" variables, e.g.,
              _$("$TERM");

   __push_list/__pop_list :
              Push list items onto the stack

   prod(x) :
              Computes the product of an array a[0]*a[1]*...

   minabs(x), maxabs(x):
              Equivalent to min(abs(x)) and max(abs(x))

   getpgrp,setgid, getpgid:
              Get and set the process group (Unix)
   setsid  :
              Create a new session

API News
========

  Although not new I feel that this point should be stressed now
  because it was not emphasized earlier: The SLarray_* functions that
  deal with indices or sizes use `SLindex_Type' instead of `int'.
  Currently, `SLindex_Type' is typedefed to be an `int', but this will
  change in a future version.  So for future compatibility, use
  `SLindex_Type' instead of `int' in functions that deal with slang
  arrays.  Similarly, instead of using SLang_pop_int for obtaining an
  array index, use SLang_pop_array_index.  See the array-specific
  examples in the documentation for more information.

  There have been significant enhancements to the slang readline
  interface.  The interface has been opened up to the interpreter
  allowing for such features as completion and a persistent history
  mechanism.  Applications wishing to take advantage of these features
  should use the new function `SLrline_open2' instead of
  `SLrline_open'.  For an example, see how this function is used in
  slsh/src/readline.c.

  SLclass_patch_intrin_fun_table was added to facilitiate the patching
  of intrinsic tables during runtime.  If you have created dynamically
  loaded modules, then you may have a good idea what this function is
  for.

  The SLang_Traceback variable is now interpreted as a bitmapped
  integer providing greater flexibility and control over traceback
  messages.

  SLerr_throw was added to permit applications to mimic the semantics
  of the `throw' statement.

  SLang_verror_va was added to support calling the error routines with
  a va_list argument.

slsh enhancements
=================

  When configured to use slang's readline routines, new features
  include filename completion and persistent history.

  The profiler was rewritten to be much more friendly, flexible, and
  more accurate.

  struct_filter and struct_combine defined in structfuns.sl have been
  made more flxible.  See their documentation for more information.

  A new function called readascii may be used for reading
  non-binary (or so-called "ascii") data files.

New modules
===========

  The following modules have been added:

      iconv:  Performs character-set conversion using the iconv library.
      onig:   A regular expression module using oniguruma RE library.
      rand:   A random number module
