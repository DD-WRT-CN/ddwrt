This directory contains the makefile used to build modules under the
various DOS/Windows C compilers.

See the README in ../../src/mkfiles/ for more information.  The exact
same comments apply.  The only difference is that the module build
involves a recursive make.  This means that the name of the makefile
must be Makefile.
