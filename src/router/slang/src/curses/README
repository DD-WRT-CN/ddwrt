The files in this directory serve to illustrate the S-Lang library curses
emulation.  The emulation is far from complete; however, for many simple
programs, it is adequate.

The C files in the directory come from the ncurses test directory.  The only
modifications I have made to them involve adding code to stop gcc warnings,
e.g.,

./bs.c: In function `main':
./bs.c:1250: warning: control reaches end of non-void function
