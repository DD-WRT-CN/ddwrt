Before building slsh, it is wise to first build the slang library and
install it via, e.g., 'make install-elf'.

On Unix, running 'make install' will put:

    * the slsh executable in $prefix/bin/
    * lib/slsh.rc in $prefix/etc/
    * lib/*.sl in $prefix/share/slsh/

(See ../INSTALL.unx for information about $prefix.) To change these
locations, edit the Makefile.

A mingw32 windows executable may be created using Makefile.g32 via

   make -f Makefile.g32
   make -f Makefile.g32 install

As above, edit the makefile to change the installation locations.  You
may also have to put something like:

   set SLSH_PATH=C:/etc
   set SLSH_CONF_DIR=C:/etc

in your autoexec.bat file and then reboot.

For a windows native slsh.exe use, e.g.,

   ..\src\mkfiles\mkmake WIN32 VC < mkfiles\makefile.all > Makefile
   nmake

(change the options to mkmake and the 'make' program name to suit your
development environment).

Good luck.
