VMS Installation instructions:

In the source directory, you will find the following files:

   vmsmake.com     VMS DCL command procedure

On VMS, just type `@vmsmake' or if you have gcc, type `@vmsmake gcc'.

Note: Since I nolonger have access to VMS, I cannot guarantee that the
library will compile cleanly under VMS.
