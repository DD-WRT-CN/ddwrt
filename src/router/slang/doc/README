The documentation here is provided in text format.  Documentation in
SGML, HTML, TeX, and postscript formats are also available from
<ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/v2.0/slang-doc.tar.gz> as well as the
mirror sites.  In addition, the documentation is available on-line from
<http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/docs.html>.

The text subdirectory contains:

   text/slang.txt    Documentation describing the slang language
   text/cslang.txt   C programmer's guide to the library
   text/cref.txt     Reference Manual for the C functions
   text/slangfun.txt Reference Manual for the slang intrinsic functions

There may be additional subdirectories:

   tm/               Text-Macro source for documentation
   html/             Documentation in HTML form
   text/             Documentation in text form
   ps/               Documentation in postscript (from LaTeX)
   pdf/              Documentation in postscript (from pdflatex)

The documentation was created by linuxdoc-tools from an SGML format,
which itself was created from text-macro source.  The LaTeX2e output
produced by linuxdoc-tools needed some additional tweaking by the
script tm/fixtex.sl.
