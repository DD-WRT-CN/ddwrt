.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
gpsfake is a test harness for gpsd and its clients\&. It opens a pty (pseudo\-TTY), launches a gpsd instance that thinks the slave side of the pty is its GPS device, and repeatedly feeds the contents of a test logfile through the master side to the GPS\&.

.PP
gpsfake does not require root privileges, and can be run concurrently with a production gpsd instance without causing problems\&.

.PP
The logfile may be of NMEA, SiRF packets, TSIP packets, or Zodiac packets\&. Leading lines beginning with # will be treated as comments and ignored\&.

.PP
The gpsd instance is run in foreground\&. The thread sending fake GPS data to the daemon is run in background\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
With the \-1 option, the logfile is interpreted once only rather than repeatedly\&. This option is intended to facilitate regression testing\&.

.PP
The \-b option enables a twirling\-baton progress indicator on standard error\&. At termination, it reports elapsed time\&.

.PP
The \-c option sets the delay between sentences in seconds\&. Fractional values of seconds are legal\&. The default is zero (no delay)\&.

.PP
The \-l option makes the program dump a line or packet number just before each sentence is fed to the daemon\&. If the sentence is textual (e\&.g\&. NMEA), the text is dumped as well\&. If not, the packet will be dumped in hexadecimal (except for RTCM packets, which aren't dumped at all)\&. This option is useful for checking that gpsfake is getting packet boundaries right\&.

.PP
The \-i option is for single\-stepping through logfiles\&. It dumps the line or packet number (and the sentence if the protocol is textual) followed by "? "\&. Only when the user keys Enter is the line actually fed to gpsd\&.

.PP
The \-m option specifies a monitor program inside which the daemon should be run\&. This option is intended to be used with \fBvalgrind\fR(1), \fBgdb\fR(1) and similar programs\&.

.PP
The \-g option uses the monitor facility to run the gpsd within gpsfake under control of gdb\&.

.PP
The \-o option specifies options to pass to the daemon\&. The \-n option passes \-n to start the daemon reading the GPS without waiting for a client (equivalent to \-o "\-n")\&. The \-D option passes a \-D option to the daemon: thus \-D 4 is shorthand for \-o "\-D 4"\&.

.PP
The \-p option dumps the NMEA and GPSD notifications generated by the log to standard output\&.

.PP
The \-r option specifies an initialization comand to use\&. The default is "w+r+"; "r=2" might be another interesting value\&.

.PP
The \-s option sets the baud rate for the slave tty\&. The default is 4800\&.

.PP
The \-v option enables verbose progress reports to stderr\&. It is mainly useful for debugging gpsfake itself\&.

.PP
The \-h option makes gpsfake print a usage message and exit\&.

.PP
The argument must be the name of a file containing the data to be cycled at the device\&. gpsfake will print a notification each time it cycles\&.

.SH "CUSTOM TESTS"

.PP
gpsfake is a trivial wrapper around a Python module, also named gpsfake, that can be used to fully script sessions involving a gpsd instance, any number of client sessions, and any number of fake GPSes feeding the daemon instance with data from specified sentence logs\&.

.PP
Source and embedded documentation for this module is shipped with the gpsd development tools\&. You can use it to torture\-test either gpsd itself or any gpsd\-aware client application\&.
