.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
gpspipe is a tool to connect to gpsd and output the received sentences to stdout\&. This makes the program useful as a pipe from gpsd to another program or file\&.

.PP
gpspipe does not require root privileges, and can be run concurrently with other tools connecting to the local gpsd without causing problems\&.

.PP
The output will consist of one or both of the raw NMEA or native gpsd sentences\&. Each line can be optionally time stamped\&. There is also an option to exit gracefully after a given count of packets\&.

.PP
An optional argument may specify a server to get data from; a colon\-separated suffix is taken as a port number\&. If omitted, it connects to localhost on the default port (2947)\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
\-h makes gpspipe print a usage message and exit\&.

.PP
\-r causes raw NMEA sentences to be output\&.

.PP
\-R causes super\-raw (gps binary) data to be output\&. This overrides NMEA and gpsd output modes\&.

.PP
\-s option causes the collected data to be written to the specified serial device with setttings 4800 8N1\&. Thus gpspipe can be used with \-s and \-r options to emulate a serial port hardwired to a GPS that gpsd is managing\&.

.PP
\-w causes native gpsdsentences to be output\&.

.PP
\-t adds a timestamp to each sentence output\&.

.PP
\-n [count] causes [count] sentences to be output\&. gpspipe will then exit gracefully\&.

.PP
\-j makes the program send J=1 to the daemon, requesting fix hold across cycles\&.

.PP
\-v causes gpspipe to show a spinning activity indicator on stderr\&. This is useful if stdout is redirected into a file or a pipe\&. By default the spinner is advanced with every messages written; specifying \-v more than once will double the number of messages required to rotate the spinner\&.

.PP
\-V prints the version, then exits\&.

.PP
At least one of \-R \-r or \-w must be specified\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.PP
When gpsd is running  \fBgpspipe \-r \-n 100\fR will send one hundred raw NMEA sentences to standard output, then exit\&.
