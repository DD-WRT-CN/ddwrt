.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is a decoder for RTCM\-104, an obscure and complicated serial protocol used for broadcasting pseudorange corrections from differential\-GPS reference stations\&. RTCM\-104 is expected on standard input; an equivalent, 100%\-information\-preserving text format is written to standard output\&.

.PP
You can use this tool with \fBnc\fR(1) to examine RTCM feeds from DGPSIP servers or Ntrip broadcasters\&.

.PP
The decoder dump format is described in \fBrtcm\fR(5); these lines go to standard output\&. As well as data the decoder also prints decoder status messages to standard error, as necessary\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
The \-d option tells the program to decode RTCM\-104 presented on standard input to a text dump in the format of \fBrtcm\-104\fR(5) on standard output\&. This is the default behavior\&.

.PP
The \-e option option tells the program to encode a text dump in the format of \fBrtcm\-104\fR(5) to standard output\&.

.PP
The \-V option directs the program to emit its version number, then exit\&.

.PP
The \-v option sets a verbosity level\&. It is mainly of interest to developers\&.

.SH "APPLICABLE STANDARDS"

.PP
The applicable standard is RTCM Recommended Standards for Differential NAVSTAR GPS Service RTCM Paper 194\-93/SC 104\-STD\&.

.PP
Ordering instructions are accessible from the website of the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services: \fIhttp://www.rtcm.org/\fR under "Publications"\&.

.SH "BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"

.PP
RTCM\-104 represents floating\-point quantities as an integer multiple of a fixed scale factor\&. Editing an RTCM\-104 dump can produce numbers that are not an integer multiple of the scale factor for their field\&. If you do this, the value actually packed into binary RTCM\-104 will be rounded down to the nearest scale unit, and dumping will show slightly different numbers than those you entered\&.

.PP
The decoder logic is sufficiently convoluted to confuse some compiler optimizers, notably in GCC 3\&.x at \-O2, into generating bad code\&.
