.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
gpsctl can switch a dual\-mode GPS between NMEA and vendor\-binary modes\&. It can also be used to set the device baudrate\&. Note: Not all devices have these capabilities\&.

.PP
If you have only one GPS attached to your machine, and gpsd is running, it is not necessary to specify the device; gpsctl does its work through gpsd, which will locate it for you\&.

.PP
When gpsd is not running, the device specification is required, and you will almost certainly need to be running as root in order to have write access to the device\&.

.PP
The program accepts the following options:

.TP
\-b
Put GPS into binary mode\&. After the GPS resets itself autobaud to the new speed\&.

.TP
\-n
Put GPS into NMEA mode\&. After the GPS resets itself autobaud to its new speed\&.

.TP
\-f
Force low\-level access (not through the daemon)\&.

.TP
\-l
List the known device types and exit\&.\&.

.TP
\-s
Set the baud rate at which the GPS emits packets\&.

.TP
\-t
Force the device type\&.

.TP
\-h
Display program usage and exit\&.

.TP
\-D
Set level of debug messages\&.

.TP
\-V
Display program version and exit\&.

.PP
The argument of the forcing option\&. \fB\-t\fR, should be a string which should be contained in exactly one of the known driver names; for a list, do \fBgpsctl \-l\fR\&.

.PP
Forcing the device type behaves somewhat differently depending on whether this tool, is going through the daemon or not\&. In high\-level mode, if the device that daemon selects for you doesn't match the driver you specified, gpsctl exits with a warning\&. (This may be useful in scripts\&.)

.PP
In low\-level mode, if the device identifies as a Generic NMEA, use the selected driver instead\&. This will be useful if you have a GPS device of known type that is in NMEA mode and not responding to probes\&. (This option was originally implemented for talking to SiRFStar I chips, which don't respond to the normal SiRF ID probe\&.)

.PP
If no options are given, the program will display a message identifying the GPS type of the selected device and exit\&.
