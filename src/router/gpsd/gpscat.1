.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
gpscat is a simple program for logging and packetizing GPS data streams\&. It takes input from a specified file or serial device (presumed to have a GPS attached) and reports to standard output\&. The program runs until end of input or ot is interrupted by ^C or other means\&.

.PP
In raw mode (the default) gpscat simply dumps its input to standard output\&. Nonprintable characters are rendered as hexadecimal string escapes, except for CR followed by LF or LF preceded by CR\&.

.PP
In packetizing mode, gpscat uses the same code as \fBgpsd\fR(8)'s packet sniffer to break the input into packets\&. Packets are reported one per line; line breaks in the packets themselves are escaped\&.

.PP
This program is useful as a sanity checker when examining a new device\&. It can be used as a primitive NMEA logger, but beware that (a) interrupting it likely to cut off output in mid\-sentence, and (b) to avoid displaying incomplete NMEA sentences right up next to shell prompts that often contain a $, raw mode always emits an extra final linefeed\&.

.PP
Also, be aware that packetizing mode will produce useless results -- probably consuming the entirety of input and appearing to hang -- if it is fed data that is not a sequence of packets of one of the known types\&.

.PP
The program accepts the following options:

.TP
\-p
Invoke packetizer mode\&.

.TP
\-s
Set the port's baud rate (and optionally its parity and stop bits) before reading\&. Argument should begin with one of the normal integer baud rates (300, 1200, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, etc\&.)\&. It may be followed by an optional suffix [NOE][12] to set parity (None, Even, Odd) and stop bits (1 or 2)\&.

.TP
\-t
Invoke packetizer mode, with the packet type reported before a colon on each line\&.

.TP
\-h
Display program usage and exit\&.

.TP
\-V
Display program version and exit\&.

.PP
Specifying \-s 4800N1 is frequently helpful with unknown devices\&.
