@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction
@cindex introduction

GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying to rescue the
good parts first in case of read errors.

The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you don't
have to wait for an error, stop the program, read the log, restart it
from a new position, etc.

If you use the logfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently, (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point.

Ddrescue does not write zeros to the output when it finds bad sectors in
the input, and does not truncate the output file if not asked to. So,
every time you run it on the same output file, it tries to fill in the
gaps without wiping out the data already rescued.

Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies of
a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time, with
the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and error-free
file. This is so because the probability of having the same area damaged
in all copies is low (if the errors are randomly located). Using the
logfile, only the needed blocks are read from the second and successive
copies.

Ddrescue recommends lzip for compression of backups because the lzip
format is designed for long-term data archiving and provides data
recovery capabilities which nicely complement those of ddrescue.
(Ddrescue fills unreadable sectors with data from other copies, while
lziprecover corrects corrupt sectors with data from other copies). If
the cause of file corruption is damaged media, the combination ddrescue
+ lziprecover is the best option for recovering data from multiple
damaged copies. @xref{lziprecover-example}, for an example.

Recordable CD and DVD media keep their data only for a finite time
(typically for many years). After that time, data loss develops slowly
with read errors growing from the outer media region towards the inside.
Just make two (or more) copies of every important CD/DVD you burn so
that you can later recover them with ddrescue.

Because ddrescue needs to read and write at random places, it only works
on seekable (random access) input and output files.

If your system supports it, ddrescue can use direct disc access to read
the input file, bypassing the kernel cache.

Ddrescue also features a "fill mode" able to selectively overwrite parts
of the output file, which has a number of interesting uses like wiping
data, marking bad areas or even, in some cases, "repair" damaged
sectors.

One of the great strengths of ddrescue is that it is interface-agnostic,
and so can be used for any kind of device supported by your kernel (ATA,
SATA, SCSI, old MFM drives, floppy discs, or even flash media cards like
SD).


@node Basic concepts
@chapter Basic concepts
@cindex basic concepts

@table @asis
@item Block
Any amount of data. A block is described by its starting position and
its size. The starting position (or beginning position) is the lowest
position in the block. The end of the block is its starting position
plus its size.

@item Cluster
Group of consecutive sectors read or written in one go.

@item Device
Piece of hardware containing data. Hard disc drives, cdrom drives, USB
pendrives, are devices. /dev/hda, /dev/sdb, are device names.

@item File
Files are named units of data which are stored by the operating system
for you to retrieve later by name. Devices and partitions are accessed
by means of their associated file names.

@item Partition
Every part in which a device is divided. A partition normally contains a
file system. /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb3, are partition names.

@item Recoverable formats
As ddrescue uses standard library functions to read data from the device
being rescued, only mountable device formats can be rescued with
ddrescue. DVDs can be mounted and they can be rescued, "compact disc
digital audio" CDs can't, "video CDs"[1] maybe.@*
[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD

@item Rescue domain
Block or set of blocks to be acted upon (rescued, listed, etc). You can
define it with the options @samp{--input-position}, @samp{--size} and
@samp{--domain-logfile}. The rescue domain defaults to the whole input
file or logfile.

The amount of data rescued, number of errors, etc, shown by ddrescue may
vary or even become zero if you limit the rescue domain. Don't worry,
they have not disappeared; they are simply out of the specified rescue
domain.

@item Sector
Hardware block. Smallest accessible amount of data on a device.

@end table


@node Important advice
@chapter Using ddrescue safely
@cindex using ddrescue safely

Ddrescue is like any other power tool. You need to understand what it
does, and you need to understand some things about the machines it does
those things to, in order to use it safely.

Always use a logfile unless you know you won't need it. Without a
logfile, ddrescue can't resume a rescue, only reinitiate it.

Never try to rescue a r/w mounted partition. The resulting copy may be
useless.

Never try to repair a file system on a drive with I/O errors; you will
probably lose even more data.

If you use a device or a partition as destination, any data stored there
will be overwritten.

Some systems may change device names on reboot (eg. udev enabled
systems). If you reboot, check the device names before restarting
ddrescue.

If you interrupt the rescue and then reboot, any partially copied
partitions should be hidden before allowing them to be touched by any
operating system that tries to mount and "fix" the partitions it sees.


@node Algorithm
@chapter Algorithm
@cindex algorithm

GNU ddrescue is not a derivative of dd, nor is related to dd in any way
except in that both can be used for copying data from one device to
another. The key difference is that ddrescue uses a sophisticated
algorithm to copy data from failing drives causing them as little
additional damage as possible.

Ddrescue manages efficiently the status of the rescue in progress and
tries to rescue the good parts first, scheduling reads inside bad (or
slow) areas for later. This maximizes the amount of data that can be
finally recovered from a failing drive.

The standard dd utility can be used to save data from a failing drive,
but it reads the data sequentially, which may wear out the drive without
rescuing anything if the errors are at the beginning of the drive.

Other programs read the data sequentially but switch to small size reads
when they find errors. This is a bad idea because it means spending more
time at error areas, damaging the surface, the heads and the drive
mechanics, instead of getting out of them as fast as possible. This
behavior reduces the chances of rescuing the remaining good data.

The algorithm of ddrescue is as follows (the user may interrupt the
process at any point, but be aware that a bad drive can block ddrescue
for a long time until the kernel gives up):

1) Optionally read a logfile describing the status of a multi-part or
previously interrupted rescue. If no logfile is specified or is empty or
does not exist, mark all the rescue domain as non-tried.

2) (First phase; Copying) Read the non-tried parts of the input file,
marking the failed blocks as non-trimmed and skipping beyond them. Skip
also beyond slow areas. The skipped areas are tried later in two
additional passes (before trimming), reversing the direction after each
pass until all the rescue domain is tried. The third pass is a sweeping
pass, with skipping disabled. (The purpose is to delimit large errors
fast, keep the logfile small, and produce good starting points for
trimming). Only non-tried areas are read in large blocks. Trimming,
scraping and retrying are done sector by sector. Each sector is tried at
most two times; the first in this step as part of a large block read,
the second in one of the steps below as a single sector read.

3) (Second phase; Trimming) Trimming is done in one pass. For each
non-trimmed block, read forwards one sector at a time from the leading
edge of the block until a bad sector is found. Then read backwards one
sector at a time from the trailing edge of the block until a bad sector
is found. Then mark the bad sectors found (if any) as bad-sector, and
mark the rest of the block as non-scraped without trying to read it.

4) (Third phase; Scraping) Scrape together the data not recovered by the
copying or trimming phases. Scraping is done in one pass. Each
non-scraped block is read forwards, one sector at a time. Any bad
sectors found are marked as bad-sector.

5) (Fourth phase; Retrying) Optionally try to read again the bad sectors
until the specified number of retry passes is reached. The direction is
reversed after each pass. Every bad sector is tried only once in each
pass. Ddrescue can't know if a bad sector is unrecoverable or if it will
be eventually read after some retries.

6) Optionally write a logfile for later use.

@sp 1
The total error size (@samp{errsize}) is sum of the sizes of all the
non-trimmed, non-scraped and bad-sector blocks. It increases during the
copying phase and may decrease during trimming, scraping and retrying.
Note that as ddrescue scrapes or retries the failed blocks, the good
data found may divide them into smaller blocks, decreasing the total
error size but increasing the number of errors.

The logfile is periodically saved to disc, as well as when ddrescue
finishes or is interrupted. So in case of a crash you can resume the
rescue with little recopying. The interval between saves varies from 30
seconds to 5 minutes depending on logfile size (larger logfiles are
saved at longer intervals).

Also, the same logfile can be used for multiple commands that copy
different areas of the input file, and for multiple recovery attempts
over different subsets. See this example:

@noindent
Rescue the most important part of the disc first.
@example
ddrescue -i0 -s50MiB /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
ddrescue -i0 -s1MiB -d -r3 /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
@end example

@noindent
Then rescue some key disc areas.
@example
ddrescue -i30GiB -s10GiB /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
ddrescue -i230GiB -s5GiB /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
@end example

@noindent
Now rescue the rest (does not recopy what is already done).
@example
ddrescue /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
ddrescue -d -r3 /dev/hdc hdimage logfile
@end example


@node Invoking ddrescue
@chapter Invoking ddrescue
@cindex invoking ddrescue
@cindex options
@cindex usage
@cindex version

The format for running ddrescue is:

@example
ddrescue [@var{options}] @var{infile} @var{outfile} [@var{logfile}]
@end example

ddrescue supports the following options:

@table @samp
@item -h
@itemx --help
Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

@item -V
@itemx --version
Print the version number of ddrescue on the standard output and exit.

@item -a @var{bytes}
@itemx --min-read-rate=@var{bytes}
Minimum read rate of good non-tried areas, in bytes per second. If the
read rate falls below this value, ddrescue will skip ahead a variable
amount depending on rate and error histories. The skipped blocks are
tried in additional passes (before trimming) where the minimum read rate
is divided by ten before each pass, until there are no more non-tried
blocks left.

If @var{bytes} is 0 (auto), the minimum read rate is recalculated for
each block as @w{(average_rate / 10)}. Values above device capabilities
are ignored.

@item -A
@itemx --try-again
Mark all non-trimmed and non-scraped blocks inside the rescue domain as
non-tried before beginning the rescue. Try this if the drive stops
responding and ddrescue immediately starts scraping failed blocks when
restarted. If @samp{--retrim} is also specified, mark all failed blocks
inside the rescue domain as non-tried.

@item -b @var{bytes}
@itemx --sector-size=@var{bytes}
Sector (hardware block) size of input device in bytes (usually 512 for
hard discs and 3.5" floppies, 1024 for 5.25" floppies, and 2048 for
cdroms). Defaults to 512.

@item -B
@itemx --binary-prefixes
Show units with binary prefixes (powers of 1024).@*
SI prefixes (powers of 1000) are used by default. (See table below).

@item -c @var{sectors}
@itemx --cluster-size=@var{sectors}
Number of sectors to copy at a time. Defaults to @w{64 KiB / sector_size}.
Try smaller values for slow drives. The number of sectors per track (18
or 9) is a good value for floppies.

@item -C
@itemx --complete-only
Limit rescue domain to the blocks listed in the @var{logfile}. Do not
read new data beyond @var{logfile} limits. This is useful when reading
from devices of undefined size (like raw devices), when the drive
returns an incorrect size, or when reading from a partial copy. It can
only be used after a first rescue attempt, possibly limited with the
@samp{--size} option, has produced a complete @var{logfile}.

@item -d
@itemx --direct
Use direct disc access to read from @var{infile}, bypassing the kernel
cache. (Open the file with the O_DIRECT flag). Use it only on devices or
partitions, not on regular files. Sector size must be correctly set for
this to work. Not all systems support this.

If your system does not support direct disc access, ddrescue will warn
you. If the sector size is not correctly set, all reads will result in
errors, and no data will be rescued.

@item -D
@itemx --synchronous
Use synchronous writes for @var{outfile}. (Issue a fsync call after
every write). May be useful when forcing the drive to remap its bad
sectors.

@item -e [+]@var{n}
@itemx --max-errors=[+]@var{n}
Maximum number of error areas allowed before giving up. Defaults to
infinity. If @var{n} is preceded by @samp{+} the number refers to new
error areas found in this run, not counting those already annotated in
the @var{logfile}.

@item -E @var{bytes}
@itemx --max-error-rate=@var{bytes}
Maximum rate of errors allowed before giving up, in bytes per second.
Defaults to infinity. The rate being measured is that of actually failed
reads, so the rescue may finish because of this rate being exceeded even
if the total error size (errsize) does not change because the areas
being tried are already marked as errors.

@item -f
@itemx --force
Force overwrite of @var{outfile}. Needed when @var{outfile} is not a
regular file, but a device or partition. This option is just a safeguard
to prevent the inadvertent destruction of partitions, and is ignored for
regular files.

@item -F @var{types}
@itemx --fill-mode=@var{types}
Fill the blocks in @var{outfile} specified as any of @var{types} in
@var{logfile}, with data read from @var{infile}. @var{types} contains
one or more of the status characters defined in the chapter Logfile
structure (@pxref{Logfile structure}). See the chapter Fill mode
(@pxref{Fill mode}) for a complete description of the fill mode.

@item -G
@itemx --generate-mode
Generate an approximate @var{logfile} from the @var{infile} and
@var{outfile} of the original rescue run. Note that you must keep the
original offset between @samp{--input-position} and
@samp{--output-position} of the original rescue run. See the chapter
Generate mode (@pxref{Generate mode}) for a complete description of the
generate mode.

@item -H @var{file}
@itemx --test-mode=@var{file}
Builds a map of good/bad blocks using the logfile @var{file} and uses it
to simulate read errors in @var{infile}. The blocks marked as finished
in @var{file} will be read normally. All other block types will be
considered read errors without even trying to read them from
@var{infile}. This mode is an aid in improving the algorithm of ddrescue
and is also useful to verify that ddrescue produces accurate results in
presence of read errors.

@item -i @var{bytes}
@itemx --input-position=@var{bytes}
Starting position of the rescue domain in @var{infile}, in bytes.
Defaults to 0. This is not the point from which ddrescue starts copying.
(For example, if you pass the @samp{--reverse} option to ddrescue, it
starts copying from the end of the rescue domain). In fill mode it
refers to a position in the @var{infile} of the original rescue run. See
the chapter Fill mode (@pxref{Fill mode}) for details.

@item -I
@itemx --verify-input-size
Compare the size of @var{infile} with the size calculated from the list
of blocks contained in the @var{logfile}, and exit with status 1 if they
differ. This is not enabled by default because the size of some devices
can't be known in advance and because the size derived from the
@var{logfile} may be incomplete, for example after doing a partial
rescue.

@item -K [@var{initial}][,@var{max}]
@itemx --skip-size=[@var{initial}][,@var{max}]
Set limits to skip size during the copying phase. At least one of
@var{initial} or @var{max} must be specified. @var{initial} is the size
to skip on the first read error or slow read, in bytes. @var{max} is the
maximum size to skip. The values given will be rounded to the next
multiple of sector size. The skip size will be doubled for each read
error or slow read until it reaches @var{max} or, if @var{max} is
omitted, 1% of the size of @var{infile} or 1 GiB (whichever is smaller),
and will be reset to @var{initial} when good data is found. Valid values
range from 64 KiB to 1 GiB. @var{initial} defaults to 64 KiB. An
@var{initial} value of 0 disables skipping entirely.

If ddrescue is having difficulties skipping away from a large area with
scattered errors, or if the device has large error areas at regular
intervals, you can increase the initial skip size with this option.
Inversely, if ddrescue is skipping too much, leaving large non-tried
areas behind each error (which will be read later in the usually slower
backwards direction), you can reduce the maximum skip size, or disable
skipping.

@samp{--skip-size} is independent from @samp{--cluster-size}. The size
to skip is calculated from the end of the block that just failed.

@item -L
@itemx --loose-domain
Accept an incomplete synthetic (user fabricated) domain logfile or
test-mode logfile and fill the gaps in the list of data blocks with
non-tried blocks. The blocks in the logfile must be strictly ascending
and non-overlapping, but they do not need to be contiguous. This option
allows making quick edits to a logfile without all the size calculations
involved in making all data blocks contiguous again.

@item -m @var{file}
@itemx --domain-logfile=@var{file}
Restrict the rescue domain to the blocks marked as finished in the
logfile @var{file}. This is useful for merging partially recovered
images of backups, or if the destination drive fails during the rescue.

@item -M
@itemx --retrim
Mark all failed blocks inside the rescue domain as non-trimmed before
beginning the rescue. The effect is similar to @samp{--retry-passes=1},
but the bad sectors are tried in a different order, making perhaps
possible to rescue some of them.

@item -n
@itemx --no-scrape
Skip the scraping phase. Avoids spending a lot of time trying to rescue
the most difficult parts of the file.

@item -N
@itemx --no-trim
Skip the trimming phase. Specially useful in the first parts of a
multi-part rescue.

@item -o @var{bytes}
@itemx --output-position=@var{bytes}
Starting position of the image of the rescue domain in @var{outfile}, in
bytes. Defaults to @samp{--input-position}. The bytes below @var{bytes}
aren't touched if they exist and truncation is not requested. Else they
are set to 0.

@item -O
@itemx --reopen-on-error
Close @var{infile} and then reopen it after every read error and, if
@samp{--min-read-rate} is set, after every slow read encountered both
during the copying phase. Use this option if you notice a permanent drop
in transfer rate after finding read errors or slow areas. But be warned
that most probably the slowing-down is intentionally caused by the
kernel in an attempt to increase the probability of reading data from
the device.

@item -p
@itemx --preallocate
Preallocate space on disc for @var{outfile}. Only space for regular
files can be preallocated. If preallocation succeeds, rescue will not
fail due to lack of free space on disc. If ddrescue can't determine the
size to preallocate, you may need to specify it with some combination of
the @samp{--input-position}, @samp{--output-position}, @samp{--size},
and @samp{--domain-logfile} options.

@item -P[@var{lines}]
@itemx --data-preview[=@var{lines}]
Show @var{lines} lines of the latest data read in @w{@samp{16-byte hex +
ASCII}} format. Valid values for @var{lines} range from 1 to 32. If
@var{lines} is omitted, a default value of 3 is used.

@item -q
@itemx --quiet
Quiet operation. Suppress all messages.

@item -r @var{n}
@itemx --retry-passes=@var{n}
Exit after given number of retry passes. Defaults to 0. -1 means
infinity. Every bad sector is tried only once in each pass. To retry bad
sectors detected on a previous run, you must specify a non-zero number
of retry passes.

@item -R
@itemx --reverse
Reverse the direction of all passes (copying, trimming, scraping and
retrying). Every pass that is normally run forwards will now be run
backwards, and vice versa. @samp{--reverse} does not modify the size of
the blocks copied during each phase, just the order in which they are
tried.

@item -s @var{bytes}
@itemx --size=@var{bytes}
Maximum size of the rescue domain, in bytes. It limits the amount of
input data to be copied. If ddrescue can't determine the size of the
input device, you may need to specify it with this option. Note that
this option does not specify the size of the resulting @var{outfile}.
For example, the following command creates an @var{outfile} 300 bytes
long, but only writes data on the last 200 bytes:

@example
ddrescue -i 100 -s 200 infile outfile logfile
@end example

@item -S
@itemx --sparse
Use sparse writes for @var{outfile}. (The blocks of zeros are not
actually allocated on disc). May save a lot of disc space in some cases.
Not all systems support this. Only regular files can be sparse.

@item -t
@itemx --truncate
Truncate @var{outfile} to zero size before writing to it. Only works for
regular files, not for drives or partitions.

@item -T @var{interval}
@itemx --timeout=@var{interval}
Maximum time since last successful read allowed before giving up.
Defaults to infinity. @var{interval} is a rational number (like 1.5 or
1/2) optionally followed by one of @samp{s}, @samp{m}, @samp{h} or
@samp{d}, meaning seconds, minutes, hours and days respectively. If no
unit is specified, it defaults to seconds.

@item -u
@itemx --unidirectional
Run all passes in the same direction. Forwards by default, or backwards
if the option @samp{--reverse} is also given.

@item -v
@itemx --verbose
Verbose mode. Further -v's (up to 4) increase the verbosity level.

@item -w
@itemx --ignore-write-errors
Make fill mode ignore write errors. This is useful to avoid ddrescue
exiting because of new errors developing while wiping the good sectors
of a failing drive. Fill mode normally writes to @var{outfile} one
cluster at a time. With this option, after the first write error is
found in an area, the rest of that area is filled sector by sector.

@item -x @var{bytes}
@itemx --extend-outfile=@var{bytes}
Extend the size of @var{outfile} to make it at least @var{bytes} long.
If the size of @var{outfile} is already equal or longer than @var{bytes}
then this option does nothing. Use this option to guarantee a minimum
size for @var{outfile}. Only regular files can be extended.

@item -X
@itemx --exit-on-error
Exit after the first read error is encountered during the copying phase.
This is similar but different to @samp{--timeout=0}, which waits until
the screen status is refreshed (at least 1 second). If there is at least
one successful read per second, @samp{--timeout=0} does not make
ddrescue to exit.

This is also similar but different to @samp{--max-errors=+0}, which
exits when a new error area is found. If the read errors are adjacent to
existing error areas, no new error areas are produced (just enlarged),
and @samp{--max-errors=+0} does not make ddrescue to exit.

@item -1 @var{file}
@itemx --log-rates=@var{file}
Log rates and error sizes every second in @var{file}. If @var{file}
already exists, it will be overwritten. Every time the screen is updated
with new details, some of those details (time, input position, current
and average rates, number of errors and error size) are written to
@var{file} in a format usable by plotting utilities like gnuplot. This
allows a posterior analysis of the drive to see if it has any weak zones
(areas where the transfer rate drops well below the sustained average).

@item -2 @var{file}
@itemx --log-reads=@var{file}
Log all read operations in @var{file}. If @var{file} already exists, it
will be overwritten. Every read attempt and its result (position, size,
copied size and error size) is written to @var{file}. (The position
written is always the beginning of the block tried, even if reading
backwards). A line is also written at the beginning of each phase
(copying, trimming, scraping and retrying). Finally, a line with a time
mark is written every second (unless the read takes more time). Use this
option with caution because @var{file} may become very large very
quickly. Use lzip to compress @var{file} if you need to store or
transmit it.

@item --ask
Ask for user confirmation before starting the copy. If the first letter
of the answer is @samp{y}, ddrescue starts copying. Else it exits with
status 1.@*
If they can be obtained, ddrescue shows the model and serial number of
the input and output devices. Else it shows the size in bytes of the
corresponding file or device.

@item --cpass=@var{n}[,@var{n}]
Select what pass(es) to run during the copying phase. Valid values for
@var{n} range from 0 to 3. @samp{--cpass=0} skips the copying phase
entirely. To run only the given pass(es), specify also @samp{--no-trim}
and @samp{--no-scrape}.

@item --pause=@var{interval}
Time to wait between passes. Defaults to 0. @var{interval} is formatted
as in the option @samp{--timeout} above.

@end table

Numbers given as arguments to options (positions, sizes, rates, etc) may
be expressed as decimal, hexadecimal or octal values (using the same
syntax as integer constants in C++), and may be followed by a multiplier
and an optional @samp{B} for "byte".

Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not
found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (eg, bug) which
caused ddrescue to panic.

If ddrescue is interrupted by a signal, it updates the logfile and then
terminates by raising the signal received.


@node Logfile structure
@chapter Logfile structure
@cindex logfile structure

The logfile is a text file easy to read and edit. It is formed by three
parts, the heading comments, the status line, and the list of data
blocks. Any line beginning with @samp{#} is a comment line.

The heading comments contain the version of ddrescue or ddrescuelog that
created the logfile, the command line used, and the time when the
program started. If the logfile was created by ddrescue it will also
contain the current time when the logfile was saved and a copy of the
status message from the screen describing the operation being performed
(copying, trimming, finished, etc). They are intended as information for
the user.

The first non-comment line is the status line. It contains a
non-negative integer and a status character. The integer is the position
being tried in the input file. (The beginning of the block being tried
in a forward pass or the end of the block in a backward pass). The
status character is one of these:

@multitable {Character} {generating approximate logfile}
@item Character @tab Meaning
@item '?'       @tab copying non-tried blocks
@item '*'       @tab trimming non-trimmed blocks
@item '/'       @tab scraping non-scraped blocks
@item '-'       @tab retrying bad sectors
@item 'F'       @tab filling specified blocks
@item 'G'       @tab generating approximate logfile
@item '+'       @tab finished
@end multitable

The blocks in the list of data blocks must be contiguous and
non-overlapping.

Every line in the list of data blocks describes a block of data. It
contains 2 non-negative integers and a status character. The first
integer is the starting position of the block in the input file, the
second integer is the size (in bytes) of the block. The status character
is one of these:

@multitable {Character} {failed block bad-sector(s)}
@item Character @tab Meaning
@item '?'       @tab non-tried block
@item '*'       @tab failed block non-trimmed
@item '/'       @tab failed block non-scraped
@item '-'       @tab failed block bad-sector(s)
@item '+'       @tab finished block
@end multitable

@noindent
And here is an example logfile:

@example
# Rescue Logfile. Created by GNU ddrescue version @value{VERSION}
# Command line: ddrescue -d -c18 /dev/fd0 fdimage logfile
# Start time:   2014-05-03 09:37:44
# Current time: 2014-05-03 09:38:19
# Copying non-tried blocks... Pass 1 (forwards)
# current_pos  current_status
0x00120000     ?
#      pos        size  status
0x00000000  0x00117000  +
0x00117000  0x00000200  -
0x00117200  0x00001000  /
0x00118200  0x00007E00  *
0x00120000  0x00048000  ?
@end example

If you edit the file, you may use decimal, hexadecimal or octal values,
using the same syntax as integer constants in C++.

NOTE: Logfiles generated by a version of ddrescue prior to 1.6 lack the
status line. If you want to use an old logfile with ddrescue 1.6 or
later, you will have to insert a line like @samp{0 +} at the beginning
of the logfile.


@node Examples
@chapter A small tutorial with examples
@cindex examples

This tutorial is for those already able to use the dd command. If you
don't know what dd is, better search the net for some introductory
material about dd and GNU ddrescue first.

A failing drive tends to develop more and more errors as time passes.
Because of this, you should rescue the data from a drive as soon as you
notice the first error. Be diligent because every time a physically
damaged drive powers up and is able to output some data, it may be the
very last time that it ever will.

You should make a copy of the failing drive with ddrescue, and then try
to repair the copy. If your data is really important, use the first copy
as a master for a second copy, and try to repair the second copy. If
something goes wrong, you have the master intact to try again.

If you are trying to rescue a whole partition, first repair the copy
with e2fsck or some other tool appropriate for the type of partition you
are trying to rescue, then mount the repaired copy somewhere and try to
recover the files in it.

If the drive is so damaged that the file system in the rescued partition
can't be repaired or mounted, you will have to browse the rescued data
with an hex editor and extract the desired parts by hand or use a file
recovery tool like photorec.

If the partition table is damaged, you may try to rescue the whole disc,
then try to repair the partition table and the partitions on the copy.

If the damaged drive is not listed in /dev, then you cannot rescue it.
At least not with ddrescue.

@sp 1
@noindent
Example 1: Rescue a whole disc with two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb.@*
Note: you do not need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand, but if the
partition table on /dev/hda is damaged, you'll need to recreate it
somehow on /dev/hdb.

@example
ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
fdisk /dev/hdb
e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb1
e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb2
@end example

@noindent
Example 2: Rescue an ext2 partition in /dev/hda2 to /dev/hdb2.@*
Note: you need to create the hdb2 partition with fdisk first. hdb2
should be of appropriate type and size.

@example
ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 logfile
ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 logfile

@node Direct disc access
@chapter Direct disc access
@cindex direct disc access
@cindex raw devices

If you notice that the positions and sizes in the logfile are ALWAYS
multiples of the sector size, maybe your kernel is caching the disc
accesses and grouping them. In this case you may want to use direct disc
access or a raw device to bypass the kernel cache and rescue more of
your data.

NOTE! Sector size must be correctly set with the @samp{--sector-size}
option for this to work. Only whole sectors can be read; both
@samp{--input-position} and @samp{--size} must be a multiple of sector
size.

Try the @samp{--direct} option first. If direct disc access is not
available in your system, try raw devices. Read your system
documentation to find how to bind a raw device to a regular block
device. Some OSs provide raw access through special device names, like
/dev/rdisk.

Ddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it can be used
for direct disc access or to read from raw devices. For efficiency
reasons, also aligns it to the memory page size if page size is a
multiple of sector size. On some systems, ddrescue can't determine the
size of a raw device, so an explicit @samp{--size} or
@samp{--complete-only} option may be needed.

Using direct disc access, or reading from a raw device, may be slower or
faster than normal cached reading depending on your OS and hardware. In
case it is slower you may want to make a first pass using normal cached
reads and use direct disc access, or a raw device, only to recover the
good sectors inside the failed blocks.

@sp 1
@noindent
Example 1: using direct disc access.

@example
ddrescue -f -n /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 logfile
e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdc1
mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdc1 /mnt
@end example

@sp 1

Example 2: using a raw device.

e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdc1
mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdc1 /mnt
@end example


@node Fill mode
@chapter Fill mode
@cindex fill Mode

When ddrescue is invoked with the @samp{--fill-mode} option it operates
in "fill mode", which is different from the default "rescue mode". That
is, if you use the @samp{--fill-mode} option, ddrescue does not rescue
anything. It only fills with data read from the input file the blocks of
the output file whose status character from the logfile coincides with
one of the type characters specified as argument to the
@samp{--fill-mode} option.

In fill mode the input file may have any size. If it is too small, the
data will be duplicated as many times as necessary to fill the input
buffer. If it is too big, only the data needed to fill the input buffer
will be read. Then the same data will be written to every cluster or
sector to be filled.

Note that in fill mode the input file is always read from position 0. If
you specify a @samp{--input-position}, it refers to the original input
file from which the logfile was built, and is only used to calculate the
offset between input and output positions.

Note also that when filling the input file of the original rescue run
you should set @samp{--input-position} and @samp{--output-position} to
identical values, whereas when filling the output file of the original
rescue run you should keep the original offset between
@samp{--input-position} and @samp{--output-position}.

The @samp{--fill-mode} option implies the @samp{--complete-only} option.

In fill mode the logfile is updated to allow resumability when
interrupted or in case of a crash, but as nothing is being rescued the
logfile is not destroyed. The status line is the only part of the
logfile that is modified.

@sp 1
@noindent
The fill mode has a number of uses. See the following examples:

@noindent
Example 1: Mark parts of the rescued copy to allow finding them when
examined in an hex editor. For example, the following command line fills
all blocks marked as @samp{-} (bad-sector) with copies of the string
@w{@samp{BAD SECTOR }}:

@example
printf "BAD SECTOR " > tmpfile
ddrescue --fill-mode=- tmpfile outfile logfile
@end example

@noindent
Example 2: Wipe only the good sectors, leaving the bad sectors alone.
This way, the drive will still test bad (i.e., with unreadable sectors).
This is the fastest way of wiping a failing drive, and is specially
useful when sending the drive back to the manufacturer for warranty
replacement.

@example
ddrescue --fill-mode=+ --force /dev/zero bad_drive logfile
@end example

@noindent
Example 3: Force the drive to remap the bad sectors, making it usable
again. If the drive has only a few bad sectors, and they are not caused
by drive age, you can probably just rewrite those sectors, and the drive
will reallocate them automatically to new "spare" sectors that it keeps
for just this purpose. WARNING! This may not work on your drive.

@example
ddrescue --fill-mode=- --force --synchronous /dev/zero bad_drive logfile
@end example

@sp 1
@noindent
Fill mode can also help you to figure out, independently of the file
system used, what files are partially or entirely in the bad areas of
the disc. Just follow these steps:

1) Copy the damaged drive with ddrescue until finished. Do not use
sparse writes. This yields a logfile with only finished (@samp{+}) and
bad-sector (@samp{-}) blocks.

2) Fill the bad-sector blocks of the copied drive or image file with a
string not present in any file, for example "DEADBEEF".

3) Mount the copied drive (or the image file, via loopback device).

4) Grep for the fill string in all the files. Those files containing the
string reside (at least partially) in damaged disc areas. Note that if
all the damaged areas are in unused space, grep will not find the string
in any file, which means that no files are damaged.

5) Unmount the copied drive or image file.

6) Optionally fill the bad-sector blocks of the copied drive or image
file with zeros to restore the disc image.

@noindent
Example 4: Figure out what files are in the bad areas of the disc.

@example
ddrescue -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage logfile
printf "DEADBEEF" > tmpfile
ddrescue --fill-mode=- tmpfile cdimage logfile
rm tmpfile
mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro cdimage /mnt/cdimage
find /mnt/cdimage -type f -exec grep -l "DEADBEEF" '@{@}' ';'
umount /mnt/cdimage
ddrescue --fill-mode=- /dev/zero cdimage logfile
@end example


@node Generate mode
@chapter Generate mode
@cindex generate Mode

NOTE: When ddrescue is invoked with the @samp{--generate-mode} option it
operates in "generate mode", which is different from the default "rescue
mode". That is, if you use the @samp{--generate-mode} option, ddrescue
does not rescue anything. It only tries to generate a logfile for later
use.

So you didn't read the tutorial and started ddrescue without a logfile.
Now, two days later, your computer crashed and you can't know how much
data ddrescue managed to save. And even worse, you can't resume the
rescue; you have to restart it from the very beginning.

Or maybe you started copying a drive with @w{@code{dd
conv=noerror,sync}} and are now in the same situation described above.
In this case, note that you can't use a copy made by dd unless it was
invoked with the @samp{sync} conversion argument.

Don't despair (yet). Ddrescue can in some cases generate an approximate
logfile, from the input file and the (partial) copy, that is almost as
good as an exact logfile. It makes this by simply assuming that sectors
containing all zeros were not rescued.

However, if the destination of the copy was a drive or a partition, (or
an existing regular file and truncation was not requested), most
probably you will need to restart ddrescue from the very beginning.
(This time with a logfile, of course). The reason is that old data may
be present in the drive that have not been overwritten yet, and may be
thus non-tried but non-zero.

For example, if you first tried one of these commands:
@example
ddrescue infile outfile
or
dd if=infile of=outfile conv=noerror,sync
@end example

then you can generate an approximate logfile with this command:
@example
ddrescue --generate-mode infile outfile logfile
@end example

@noindent
Note that you must keep the original offset between
@samp{--input-position} and @samp{--output-position} of the original
rescue run.


@node Ddrescuelog
@chapter Ddrescuelog
@cindex ddrescuelog

Ddrescuelog is a tool that manipulates ddrescue logfiles, shows logfile
contents, converts logfiles to/from other formats, compares logfiles,
tests rescue status, and can delete a logfile if the rescue is done.
Ddrescuelog operations can be restricted to one or several parts of the
logfile if the domain setting options are used.

When performing logic operations (AND, OR, XOR) on logfiles of different
extension, only the blocks present in both files are processed.

Here are some examples of how to use ddrescuelog, alone or in
combination with other tools.

@sp 1
@noindent
Example 1: Delete the logfile if the rescue is finished (all data is
recovered without errors left).

@example
ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
ddrescuelog -d logfile
@end example

@sp 1
@noindent
Example 2: Rescue two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb and repair the file systems using badblock lists generated with
ddrescuelog. File system block size is 4096.@*
Note: you do need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand.

@example
fdisk /dev/hdb                                <-- partition /deb/hdb
ddrescue -f /dev/hda1 /dev/hdb1 logfile1
ddrescue -f /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 logfile2
ddrescuelog -l- -b4096 logfile1 > badblocks1
ddrescuelog -l- -b4096 logfile2 > badblocks2
e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks1 /dev/hdb1
e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks2 /dev/hdb2
@end example

@sp 1
@noindent
Example 3: Rescue a whole disc with two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb and repair the file systems using badblock lists generated with
ddrescuelog. Disc sector size is 512, file system block size is 4096.
Arguments to options @samp{-i} and @samp{-s} are the starting positions
and sizes of the partitions being rescued.@*
Note: you do not need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand, but if the
partition table on /dev/hda is damaged, you'll need to recreate it
somehow on /dev/hdb.

@example
ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
fdisk /dev/hdb                                <-- get partition sizes

@node Invoking ddrescuelog
@chapter Invoking ddrescuelog
@cindex invoking ddrescuelog

The format for running ddrescuelog is:

@example
ddrescuelog [@var{options}] @var{logfile}
@end example

Ddrescuelog supports the following options:

@table @samp
@item -h
@itemx --help
Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

@item -V
@itemx --version
Print the version number of ddrescuelog on the standard output and exit.

@item -a @var{old_types},@var{new_types}
@itemx --change-types=@var{old_types},@var{new_types}
Change the status of every block in the rescue domain from one type in
@var{old_types} to the corresponding type in @var{new_types}, much like
the @samp{tr} command does, and write the resulting logfile to standard
output. @var{old_types} and @var{new_types} are strings of block status
characters as defined in the chapter Logfile structure (@pxref{Logfile
structure}). Blocks whose status is not in @var{old_types} are left
unchanged. If @var{new_types} is shorter than @var{old_types} the last
type of @var{new_types} is repeated as many times as necessary.

@item -b @var{bytes}
@itemx --block-size=@var{bytes}
Block size used by ddrescuelog. Depending on the requested operation it
may be the sector size of the input device, the block size of the
rescued file system, etc. Defaults to 512.

@item -B
@itemx --binary-prefixes
Show units with binary prefixes (powers of 1024).@*
SI prefixes (powers of 1000) are used by default. (See table above,
@ref{Invoking ddrescue}).

@item -c[@var{type1}@var{type2}]
@itemx --create-logfile[=@var{type1}@var{type2}]
Create a logfile from a list of block numbers read from standard input.
Only blocks included in the rescue domain will be added to @var{logfile}.

@var{type1} and @var{type2} are block status characters as defined in
the chapter Logfile structure (@pxref{Logfile structure}). @var{type1}
sets the type for blocks included in the list, while @var{type2} sets
the type for the rest of the logfile. If not specified, @var{type1}
defaults to @samp{+} and @var{type2} defaults to @samp{-}.

@item -C[@var{type}]
@itemx --complete-logfile[=@var{type}]
Complete a synthetic (user fabricated) @var{logfile} by filling the gaps
with blocks of type @var{type}, and write the completed logfile to
standard output. @var{type} is one of the block status characters
defined in the chapter Logfile structure (@pxref{Logfile structure}). If
@var{type} is not specified, the gaps are filled with non-tried blocks.
All gaps in the logfile are filled. Domain options are ignored.

@item -d
@itemx --delete-if-done
Delete the given @var{logfile} if all the blocks in the rescue domain
have been successfuly recovered. The exit status is 0 if @var{logfile}
could be deleted, 1 otherwise.

@item -D
@itemx --done-status
Test if all the blocks in the rescue domain have been successfuly
recovered. The exit status is 0 if all tested blocks are finished, 1
otherwise.

@item -f
@itemx --force
Force overwrite of @var{logfile}.

@item -i @var{bytes}
@itemx --input-position=@var{bytes}
Starting position of the rescue domain, in bytes. Defaults to 0. It
refers to a position in the original input file.

@item -l @var{types}
@itemx --list-blocks=@var{types}
Print on standard output the block numbers of the blocks specified as
any of @var{types} in @var{logfile} and included in the rescue domain.
@var{types} contains one or more of the block status characters defined
in the chapter Logfile structure (@pxref{Logfile structure}).

The list format is one block number per line in decimal, like the output
of the badblocks program, so that it can be used as input for e2fsck or
other similar filesystem repairing tool.

@item -L
@itemx --loose-domain
Accept an incomplete synthetic (user fabricated) domain logfile or
compare-as-domain logfile and fill the gaps in the list of data blocks
with non-tried blocks. The blocks in the logfile must be strictly
ascending and non-overlapping, but they do not need to be contiguous.
This option allows making quick edits to a logfile without all the size
calculations involved in making all data blocks contiguous again.

@item -m @var{file}
@itemx --domain-logfile=@var{file}
Restrict the rescue domain to the blocks marked as finished in the
logfile @var{file}.

@item -n
@itemx --invert-logfile
Invert the types of the blocks in @var{logfile} which are included in
the rescue domain, and write the resulting logfile to standard output.
Finished blocks (@samp{+}) are changed to bad-sector (@samp{-}), all
other types are changed to finished. @samp{--invert-logfile} is
equivalent to @samp{--change-types=?*/-+,++++-}

@item -o @var{bytes}
@itemx --output-position=@var{bytes}
Starting position of the image of the rescue domain in the output file,
in bytes. Is used by the @samp{--list-blocks} option. Defaults to
@samp{--input-position}.

@item -p @var{file}
@itemx --compare-logfile=@var{file}
Compare the types of the blocks included in the rescue domain. The exit
status is 0 if all tested blocks are the same in both @var{file} and
@var{logfile}, 1 otherwise.

@item -P @var{file}
@itemx --compare-as-domain=@var{file}
Compare only the blocks marked as finished in the rescue domain. The
exit status is 0 if all tested blocks are the same in both @var{file}
and @var{logfile}, 1 otherwise. Two files comparing equal with this
option are equivalent when used as domain logfiles.

@item -q
@itemx --quiet
Quiet operation. Suppress all messages.

@item -s @var{bytes}
@itemx --size=@var{bytes}
Maximum size of the rescue domain, in bytes. It refers to a size in the
original input file.

@item -t
@itemx --show-status
Print a summary of @var{logfile} contents on the standard output. The
summary can be restricted to one or several parts of @var{logfile} if
the domain setting options are used.

@item -v
@itemx --verbose
Verbose mode. Further -v's (up to 4) increase the verbosity level.

@item -x @var{file}
@itemx --xor-logfile=@var{file}
Perform a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between the finished
blocks in @var{file} and those in @var{logfile}, and write the resulting
logfile to standard output. In other words, in the resulting logfile a
block is only shown as finished if it was finished in either of the two
input logfiles but not in both.

@item -y @var{file}
@itemx --and-logfile=@var{file}
Perform a logical AND operation between the finished blocks in
@var{file} and those in @var{logfile}, and write the resulting logfile
to standard output. In other words, in the resulting logfile a block is
only shown as finished if it was finished in both input logfiles.

@item -z @var{file}
@itemx --or-logfile=@var{file}
Perform a logical OR operation between the finished blocks in @var{file}
and those in @var{logfile}, and write the resulting logfile to standard
output. In other words, in the resulting logfile a block is shown as
finished if it was finished in either of the two input logfiles.

@end table

Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file not
found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (eg, bug) which
caused ddrescuelog to panic.

There are probably bugs in ddrescue. There are certainly errors and
omissions in this manual. If you report them, they will get fixed. If
you don't, no one will ever know about them and they will remain unfixed
for all eternity, if not longer.

If you find a bug in GNU ddrescue, please send electronic mail to
@email{bug-ddrescue@@gnu.org}. Include the version number, which you can
find by running @w{@samp{ddrescue --version}}.
