Changes in version 1.19:

A race condition at start of run with "--timeout=0" has been fixed.

The new option "-P, --data-preview", which makes ddrescue show a few
lines of the latest data read, has been added.

The new option "-u, --unidirectional", which runs all passes in the same
direction (forwards or backwards), has been added.

The new option "-X, --exit-on-error", which makes ddrescue exit after
the first read error is encountered during the copying phase, has been
added.

The new option "--ask", which asks for confirmation before starting the
copy, has been added.

The new option "--cpass", which selects what passes to run during the
copying phase, has been added.

The new option "--pause", which inserts a pause between passes, has been
added.

The option "-l, --logfile-size" is no more needed and has been removed.

Ddrescue now skips on the first error during the copying phase.

Trimming is now done in one pass and may be run in reverse.

The splitting phase has been replaced by a "scraping" phase that scrapes
together the data not recovered by the copying or trimming phases.
Scraping reads each non-scraped block forwards, one sector at a time.

The long name of option "-n" has been changed to "--no-scrape".

During the retrying phase the direction is now reversed after each pass.
Use "--unidirectional" to override.

Model and serial number of ATA devices are shown with "--ask" or "-vv"
on Linux.

The configure script now accepts the option "--enable-linux" to enable
the compilation of linux-specific code.

The license has been changed to GPL version 2 or later.
