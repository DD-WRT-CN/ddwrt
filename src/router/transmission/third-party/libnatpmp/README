This repository of libnatpmp was initialized from libnatpmp-20120821.

Then I (Leah X. Schmidt) added automatically Java bindings.  The java
bindings use JNI directly, but they use JNAerator's extractor to allow
the native libraries to be used in a simple fashion.  So you'll need
jnaerator to use them.  Running make jnitest should download JNAerator
and run a very simple test.
