An IPsec tunnel implementation for Linux
========================================

You are looking at the README file for the IPsec tunnel implementation
known as ipsec_tunnel.  This package was created to provide a very
easy to use IPsec tunnel implementation, very well suited to create
a secure VPN over an insecure network such as the Internet.  Since
the ipsec_tunnel module was based on the standard Linux kernel
network tunnels ipip and ip-gre, it is very easy to switch from an
insecure ipip tunnel to a secure IPsec tunnel.  This also means that
you use the route command to direct which packets that should enter
the tunnel device instead of IPsec specific commands.

This implementation consists of two parts.  The first is a kernel
module that implements IPsec in the Linux kernel.  This module adds a
new network device called ipsec0, which is used to communicate with
the administration tool ipsecadm.  There will be no traffic going
through this interface.

The second part is the ipsecadm tool which is used to configure the
kernel by adding, removing and showing IPsec security associations
(SAs) and tunnels.  The standard utilities ifconfig and route are
then used to control the traffic.

To begin, read the INSTALL file in this directory for installation
instructions, and then have a look at the contents of the doc
subdirectory for a tutorial and examples.

Good luck!
