You should move this directory in <fmwr_base_dir>/src/router/ipsec.

'make install' will create 'modules' directory with kernel 
modules and 'sbin' directory with ipsecadm utility.

You'll need to load cryptoapi.o before ciphers, digests and ipsec_tunnel.o
modules. 

AES key generation is not implemented in ipsecadm utility yet.
