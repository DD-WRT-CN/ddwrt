Several files supporting GNU-style builds are copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, and carry a different license from that given
below.

THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED

Permission to modify the code and to distribute modified code is granted,

A few of the files needed to use the GNU-style build procedure come with
slightly different licenses, though they are all similar in spirit.  A few
are GPL'ed, but with an exception that should cover all uses in the
collector.  (If you are concerned about such things, I recommend you look
at the notice in config.guess or ltmain.sh.)

fdlimb contains general algorithms useful for runtimes and compilers to
support strict double and float mathematical operations.

* src/classes/gnuclasspath/*

GNU Classpath is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public 
License  with the following clarification and special exception:

   "Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules 
  is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and 
  conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole 
  combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give 
  you permission to link this library with independent modules to 
  produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these 
  independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting 
  executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, 
  for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the 
  license of that module. An independent module is a module which is 
  not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, 
  you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you 
  are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this 
  exception statement from your version."

See license.terms for the text of the GNU General Public License.

* m4/{iconv.m4,lib-ld.m4,lib-link.m4,lib-prefix.m4}

Copyright (C) 1996-2003 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This file is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  As a special exception to the GNU General
Public License, this file may be distributed as part of a program
that contains a configuration script generated by Autoconf, under
the same distribution terms as the rest of that program.

The http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ website states this about the
copyright:

Please note that every macro contained in this archive is copyrighted
by its respective author, unless the macro source explicitely says
otherwise. Permission has been granted, though, to use and distribute
all macros under the following license, which is a modified version of
the GNU General Public License version 2:

Every Autoconf macro presented on this web site is free software; you
can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2, or (at your option) any later version.

They are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License
for more details. (You should have received a copy of the GNU General
Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place -- Suite 330, Boston, MA
02111-1307, USA.)

As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited
permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that
are the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU
General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even
though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU
General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material
that constitutes the Autoconf program.

Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied
(in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of
Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf
source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides
which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these
comments and executable code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never
copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf
released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute
a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception
to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless* your
modified version has the potential to copy into its output some of the
text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started
with. (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from
the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your modification has
such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception
to the GPL from your modified version.
