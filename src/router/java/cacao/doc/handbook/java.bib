  abstract =	 {Garbage collectors used in operating systems such as
                  SPIN and embedded systems such as Java and Inferno
                  must operate with limited resources and minimize
                  their impact on application
                  performance. Consequently, they must maintain short
                  real-time pauses, low overhead, and a small memory
                  footprint. Most garbage collectors are not adequate
                  because they are either not real-time or they
                  require larger heaps because they trade space for
                  time. For example, Treadmill uses segregated free
                  lists to allocate and reclaim memory in constant
                  time but at the cost of under-utilizing memory. We
                  have implemented a new version of the Treadmill
                  collector and used it in the SPIN extensible
                  operating system kernel. We chose Treadmill for its
                  excellent real-time latencies and low overhead. We
                  improve its poor memory utilization by using real-
                  time page-level management techniques that reduce
                  the fragmentation caused by segregated free
                  lists. We use page-wise collection to locate pages
                  of free memory, which are dynamically reassigned
                  between free lists as needed. We use virtual memory
                  to dynamically remap free pages into continuous
                  ranges. Our experiments demonstrate that we have
                  substantially improved memory utilization without
                  compromising latency or overhead, and that the new
                  collector performs very well for SPIN's workloads.}

                 overhead of polymorphic message sends by extending inline caches to include more
                 than one cached lookup result per call site. For a set of typical object-oriented
                 SELF programs, PICs achieve a median speedup of 11%. 
                 As an important side effect, PICs collect type information by recording all of the
                 receiver types actually used at a given call site. The compiler can exploit this
                 type information to generate better code when recompiling a method. An
                 experimental version of such a system achieves a median speedup of 27% for our set
                 of SELF programs, reducing the number of non-inlined message sends by a factor of
                 two. 
                 Implementations of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages have been limited
                 by the paucity of type information available to the compiler. The abundance of the
                 type information provided by PICs suggests a new compilation approach for these
                 languages, adaptive compilation. Such compilers may succeed in generating very
                 efficient code for the time-critical parts of a program without incurring
                 distracting compilation pauses."

                 calculus supports a key feature of object-oriented
                 languages: an object can be emulated by another object
                 that has more refined methods. Abadi and Cardelli
                 presented four first-order type systems for the
                 calculus. The simplest one is based on finite types and
                 no subtyping, and the most powerful one has both
                 recursive types and subtyping. Open until now is the
                 question of type inference, and in the presence of
                 subtyping ``the absence of minimum typings poses
                 practical problems for type inference'' (Abadi and
                 Cardelli, 1994). \par In this paper we give an $O(n^3)$

                 algorithm can be used to optimize many of the expensive
                 features of statically typed, object-oriented languages
                 -- in particular, C++ and Java. We present a new
                 optimization algorithm, Rapid Type Analysis, and show
                 that it is fast both in theory and in practice, and
                 significantly out-performs other {"}fast{"} algorithms
                 for virtual function call resolution. We present
                 optimization algorithms for the resolution of virtual
                 function calls, conversion of virtual inheritance to
                 direct inheritance, elimination of dynamic casts and
                 dynamic type checks, and removal of object
                 synchronization. These algorithms are all presented
                 within a common framework that allows them to be driven
                 by the information collected by Rapid Type Analysis, or
                 by some other type analysis algorithm. Collectively,
