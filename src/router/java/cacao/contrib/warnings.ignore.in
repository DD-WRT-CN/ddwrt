# This file must contain one line per pattern of warnings to ignore.
# Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored. Other lines must consist
# of a regexp matching the file name, followed by a colon (:), followed by a
# regexp matching the text of the warning. Optionally this may be followed by another
# colon and a line number range.
