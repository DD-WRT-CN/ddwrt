/*! \defgroup MediaServerAbstraction DLNA - Media Server Abstraction
	\brief This module allows management of a
	MediaServer's (e.g. DMS, M-DMS) state. Also works for DMS and M-DMS devices.
	
	\a MediaServerAbstraction is built on top of the generated DeviceBuilder API.
	This module essentially provides a level of abstraction from 
	the UPnP communications, such that upper application layers
	can work with structs when processing UPnP requests. This module 
	achieves this by implementing 4 roles.

 	The first role is to provide all of the dispatch points for the generated 
 	UPnP stack. Equivalently, callbacks for responding to a UPnP action/request come 
 	to all of methods defined in this module. These methods are identified by the
 	"MediaServer_ContentDirectory_" and "MediaServer_ConnectionManager_" prefixes. These methods
 	translate a UPnP request into arguments for various callbacks.
 
 	The second role is to provide callbacks to upper application layers. These
 	callbacks are identified by the \a MSA_Callback_ prefix. 
 
 	The third role for this module is to provide the methods that allow the
 	"logic behind a MediaServer" to respond to UPnP requests and update the
 	MediaServer's state as reported on the UPnP network. These "public" methods
 	are identified by the "MSA_" prefix.

	The fourth role for this module is to allow applications to set
	state parameters for the MediaServer. These "public" methods
 	are identified by the "MSA_" prefix.

	\note
 	- Each method call requires the object returned from \ref MSA_CreateMediaServer().
 
 	- All strings for the interface are assumed to be UTF8 compliant. This means
 	 that string arguments in callbacks will be sent in their UTF8-form
 	 and that all strings sent in response to a CP's action are properly
 	 encoded by the application layer in UTF8 form. 

	\warning Due to limitations in the underlying UPnP stack, 
	this module is designed to be a singleton. \ref MSA_CreateMediaServer() 
	should only be called once for an entire process.

	\warning 
 	<b>THREADING NOTE</b>
 	The \a MediaServerAbstraction is threadless. In practice, the 
	\a MediaServerAbstraction will execute callbacks on the
 	thread that executes the Microstack thread-chain. 
 	Upper layers that provide dispatch points for \a MediaServerAbstraction
	callbacks are expected
 	to return quickly, as not doing so will cause thread-starvation for UPnP 
 	communications. The dispatch points for \a MediaServerAbstraction
	callbacks should not perform
 	I/O operations, time-consuming computations, or employ locks that are not
 	sufficiently deterministic.
