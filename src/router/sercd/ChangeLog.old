Changelog for sredird
=====================

01 June 1999 - Version 1.0.0: First stable release.

02 June 1999 - Version 1.0.1: Corrected a bug on the stop size detection
function. Corrections and exstensions to the documentation. Added credits
to Tactical Software and Nordic Messaging.

07 June 1999 - Version 1.1.0: Added errno.h to the list of the
include files.  Thanks to Federico Bianchi (f.bianchi@arte.unipi.it)
for this. Added an internal buffering scheme, along with handling of the
RFC 2217 FLOWCONTROL-SUSPEND and FLOWCONTROL-RESUME, to reduce network
latency caused by TCP and socket buffering. Added also some socket options
to further reduce network latency. Fixed a bug on the polling feature.

09 June 1999 - Version 1.1.3: Added an output buffer scheme that provides
both low latency, depending on the polling interval, and reasonable cpu
consumption without limiting the global throughput. Some other minor
bug fixing.

11 June 1999 - Version 1.1.4: Fixed compilation under SCO OpenServer
and SCO like distributions (Red Hat). Thanks to Anthony Veale
(aveale@hotmail.com) and Harri Vartiainen (harriv@sci.fi) for reporting
the problem and testing the fixed version. Fixed some other minor bugs.

18 June 1999 - Version 1.1.5: SCO support abandoned. Providing SCO
support would require huge changes to the code. Minor cosmetic and
documentation changes.

04 September 1999 - Version 1.1.6: Corrected an important bug where 
bytes directed to the socket were sent to the modem, then read back
through the modem device and finally sent to the socket macking things
apparently working. Many thanks to Ayman Akt (ayman@uniware.com.au)
from UniWare (www.uniware.com.au) for discovering this nasty bug.

20 September 1999 - Version 1.1.7: Improved handling of the clocal 
tty flag.

09 November 2000 - Version 1.1.8: Corrected a bug in the telnet option
negotiation code. Many options were always incorrectly negotiated as
TN_TRANSMIT_BINARY. Thanks to David Yon (yon@rfdsoftware.com) for his
bug report. Changed the default speed to 9600 baud instead of 38400 when
an unknown baud rate is asked by the client. Furthermore now SRedird try
to serve anyway when the client refuse the Com Port Control option. Added
a simple makefile. Thanks to Kevin Bertram (kevin@cate.com.au) for
suggesting this improvements and supplying the makefile. Changed e-mail
and web references everywere.

14 January 2002 - Version 2.0.0, fixes the following bugs:

 . Cisco IOS returns 0 to the client when INBOUND flow control is SET but
   not supported seperately from OUTBOUND.
  
 . Telnet negotiations are used alter the states of both the client
   and the server.  sredird did not implement a Telnet state machine
   as required by RFC 854.  Version 2.0 adds support for a state
   machine.

 . Version 1.1.8 corrected the negotiation of Telnet Binary mode
   (RFC 856).  However, it never implemented it.  This is now 
   corrected.

 . Telnet DO ECHO should not be refused.  The modem handles the echoing
   if necessary.

 . RFC 2217 allows the server (sredird) to give control over a serial
   port to the client (server in DO mode).  It also allows the client
   to give control over a serial port to the server (server in WILL mode).
   sredird required both modes even though sredird only offers control
   over a serial port.

 . sredird did not properly implement flow control.  Buffering was only
   implemented when writing data to the serial port.  Data was not 
   buffered when reading data from the serial port.  This could have
   resulted in inadvertent blocking.  Proper select() driven reads
   and writes are now implemented.

14 November 2002 - Version 2.1.0:

 . GetPortFlowControl should return 1 to indicate NO FLOW CONTROL
   instead of 0.

 . The Cisco IOS hack should become activated only if set by command-
   line option [-i].

 . Changed the order of checks in the EscWriteChar function for slightly
   better performance

09 July 2003 - Version 2.2.0

 mario@viara.info:

 . Fixed set port data size now work with 5 6 7 8 bits.

 . Add version in get signature.

 Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>:

 . Many minor changes and code cleanup
