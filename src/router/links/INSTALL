Links

Compile:

Unix - use ./configure; make
	in some FreeBSD 3 distributions you have to set CFLAGS=-aout before
	running ./configure.
	Tested on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, IRIX
	If counfigure fails, you can try generic makefile: make -f Makefile.gen

OS/2 - you can use ./configure. If it fails or if you don't have bash, use
	make -f Makefile.gen
	The only supported compiler is EMX, you probably won't be able to
	compile it with anything else

	configure under OS/2 needs to know paths to gcc, make anb bash. Set (for
	example):
	SET HOSTTYPE=i586
	SET MACHTYPE=i586-pc-os2
	SET CONFIG_SHELL=d:/prg/gnu/bin/bash.exe
	SET CC=d:/prg/emx/bin/gcc.exe
	SET MAKE=d:/prg/emx/bin/make.exe
	SET EMXOPT=-h100

Dos, Windows - port it yourself

Install:

Unix - make install

OS/2 - copy file links.exe somewhere to your path or create CMD file that runs
	links

WARNING: EMX has nasty limit of open files. Links will work badly or won't work
	with default settings. Set variable EMXOPT=-h100 before you run links.
