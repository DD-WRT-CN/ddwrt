<br>
The Security screen allows you to change the Router's security
settings. It is strongly recommended that you change the factory
default password of the Router, which is admin. All users who try to
access the Router's web-based utility or Setup Wizard will be prompted
for the Router's password. <br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Router Password</span><br>
<br>
The new Password must not exceed 32 characters in length and must not
include any spaces. Enter the new Password a second time to confirm it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">VPN Pass-Through</span><br>
<br>
Virtual Private Networking (VPN) is typically used for work-related
networking. For VPN tunnels, the Router supports IPSec Pass-Through and
PPTP Pass-Through. <br>
<br>
* IPSec - Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is a suite of protocols
used to implement secure exchange of packets at the IP layer. To allow
IPSec tunnels to pass through the Router, IPSec Pass-Through is enabled
by default. To disable IPSec Pass-Through, uncheck the box next to
IPSec. <br>
<br>
* PPTP - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is the method used to enable
VPN sessions to a Windows NT 4.0 or 2000 server. To allow PPTP tunnels
to pass through the Router, PPTP Pass-Through is enabled by default. To
disable PPTP Pass-Through, uncheck the box next to PPTP. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DMZ </span><br>
<br>
The DMZ hosting feature allows one local user to be exposed to the
Internet for use of a special-purpose service such as Internet gaming
or videoconferencing. DMZ hosting forwards all the ports at the same
time to one PC. The Port Forwarding feature is more secure because it
only opens the ports you want to have opened, while DMZ hosting opens
all the ports of one computer, exposing the computer so the Internet
can see it. <br>
<br>
Any PC whose port is being forwarded must have its DHCP client function
disabled and should have a new static IP address assigned to it because
its IP address may change when using the DHCP function. <br>
<br>
1. To expose one PC, select Enable. <br>
<br>
2. Enter the computer's IP address in the DMZ Host IP Address field.
<br>
<br>
3. Click the Apply button. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Block WAN Request</span><br>
<br>
By enabling the Block WAN Request feature, you can prevent your network
from being "pinged," or detected, by other Internet users. The Block
WAN Request feature also reinforces your network security by hiding
your network ports. Both functions of the Block WAN Request feature
make it more difficult for outside users to work their way into your
network. This feature is enabled by default. Select Disable to disable
this feature. <br>
<br>
<br>
Check all the values and click Apply to save your settings. Click
Cancel to cancel your unsaved changes.
