The DHCP screen allows you to configure the settings for the Router's
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server function. The Router
can be used as a DHCP server for your network. A DHCP server
automatically assigns an IP address to each computer on your network.
If you choose to enable the Router's DHCP server option, you must
configure all of your network PCs to connect to a DHCP server, the
Router. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DHCP Server</span> <br>
<br>
Keep the default, Enable, to enable the Router' DHCP server option. If
you already have a DHCP server on your network or you do not want a
DHCP server, then select Disable.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting IP Address</span><br>
<br>
Enter a numerical value for the DHCP server to start with when issuing
IP addresses. Do not start with 192.168.1.1 (the IP address of the
Router).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximum Number of DHCP Users</span> <br>
<br>
Enter the maximum number of PCs that you want the DHCP server to assign
IP addresses to. The absolute maximum is 253--possible if 192.168.1.2
is your starting IP address.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Client Lease Time</span><br>
<br>
The Client Lease Time is the amount of time a network user will be
allowed connection to the Router with their current dynamic IP address.
Enter the amount of time, in minutes, that the user will be "leased"
this dynamic IP address.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Static DNS 1-3 </span><br>
<br>
The Domain Name System (DNS) is how the Internet translates domain or
website names into Internet addresses or URLs. Your ISP will provide
you with at least one DNS Server IP Address. If you wish to utilize
another, enter that IP Address in one of these fields. You can enter up
to three DNS Server IP Addresses here. The Router will utilize these
for quicker access to functioning DNS servers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WINS </span><br>
<br>
The Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) manages each PC's
interaction with the Internet. If you use a WINS server, enter that
server's IP Address here. Otherwise, leave this blank. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Currently Assigned</span><br>
<br>
Click the DHCP Clients Table button to see a list of PCs assigned IP
addresses by the Router. For each PC, the list shows the Client
Hostname, IP Address, MAC Address, and the amount of DHCP client lease
time left. Click the Refresh button to display the most current
information. Click the Delete box next to any client whose IP address
you wish to delete. Click the Close button to exit this screen. <br>
<br>
<br>
Check all the values and click Apply to save your settings. Click
Cancel to cancel your unsaved changes.
