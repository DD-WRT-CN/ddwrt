<br>
The System screen lets you enable a variety of the Router's general
features, from restoring factory defaults to enabling its remote
management capability. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Restore Factory Defaults </span><br>
<br>
Click the Yes button to reset all configuration settings to their
default values, and then click the Apply button. <br>
<br>
Note: Any settings you have saved will be lost when the default
settings are restored. This feature is disabled by default. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade Firmware</span><br>
<br>
Click the Upgrade button to load new firmware onto the Router. New
firmware versions are posted at www.linksys.com and can be downloaded
for free. If the Router is not experiencing difficulties, then there is
no need to download a more recent firmware version, unless that version
has a new feature that you want to use.<br>
Note: When you upgrade the Router's firmware, you may lose its
configuration settings, so make sure you write down the Router settings
before you upgrade its firmware<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To upgrade the Router's firmware:
</span><br>
<br>

<br>
2. Extract the firmware upgrade file.
<br>
<br>
3. Click the Upgrade button.
<br>
<br>
4. On the Firmware Upgrade screen, click the Browse button to find the
firmware upgrade file.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Note: Do not power off the Router or press the Reset button while the
firmware is being upgraded.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Multicast Pass-Through </span><br>
<br>
IP Multicasting occurs when a single data transmission is sent to
multiple recipients at the same time. Using the Multicast Pass-Through
feature, the Router allows IP multicast packets to be forwarded to the
appropriate computers. Keep the default setting, Enable, to support the
feature, or select Disable to disable it. <br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MAC Cloning</span><br>
<br>
The Router's MAC address is a 12-digit code assigned to a unique piece
of hardware for identification. Some ISPs require that you register the
MAC address of your network card/adapter, which was connected to your
cable or DSL modem during installation. If your ISP requires MAC
address registration, find your adapter MAC address by following the
instructions for your PC operating system. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For Windows 98 and Millennium:
</span><br>
<br>
1. Click the Start button, and select Run.<br>
<br>
2. Type winipcfg in the field provided, and press the OK key.
<br>
<br>
3. Select the Ethernet adapter you are using.
<br>
<br>
4. Click More Info.
<br>
<br>
5. Write down your adapter's MAC address. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For Windows 2000 and XP:
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
1. Click the Start button, and select Run. <br>
<br>
2. Type cmd in the field provided, and press the OK key.
<br>
<br>
3. At the command prompt, run ipconfig /all, and look at your adapter's
physical address.
<br>
<br>
4. Write down your adapter's MAC address. <br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To clone your network adapter's MAC</span>
address onto the Router and avoid calling your ISP to change the
registered MAC address, follow these instructions: <br>
<br>
1. Select Enable.
<br>
<br>
2. Enter your adapter's MAC address in the MAC Address field. <br>
<br>
3. Click the Apply button. To disable MAC address cloning, keep the
default setting, Disable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Remote Management </span><br>
<br>
This feature allows you to manage your Router from a remote location,
via the Internet. To disable this feature, keep the default setting,
Disable. To enable this feature, select Enable, and use the specified
port (default is 8080) on your PC to remotely manage the Router. You
must also change the Router's default password to one of your own, if
you haven already. A unique password will increase security. <br>
<br>
To remotely manage the Router, enter http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080 (the
x's represent the Router's Internet IP address, and 8080 represents the
specified port) in your web browser's Address field. You will be asked
for the Router's password. After successfully entering the password,
you will be able to access the Router's web-based utility. <br>
<br>
Note: If the Remote Management feature is enabled, anyone who knows the
Router's Internet IP address and password will be able to alter the
Router's settings. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MTU </span><br>
<br>
MTU is the Maximum Transmission Unit. It specifies the largest packet
size permitted for Internet transmission. Keep the default setting,
Auto, to have the Router select the best MTU for your Internet
connection. To specify a MTU size, select Manual, and enter the value
desired (default is 1400). You should leave this value in the 1200 to
1500 range. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Log</span><br>
<br>
The Router can keep logs of all incoming or outgoing traffic for your
Internet connection. To keep activity logs, select Enable. To see a
temporary log of the Router's most recent incoming traffic, click the
Incoming Access Log button. To see a temporary log of the Router's most
recent outgoing traffic, click the Outgoing Access Log button. <br>
<br>
<br>
Check all the values and click Apply to save your settings. Click
Cancel to cancel your unsaved changes.
