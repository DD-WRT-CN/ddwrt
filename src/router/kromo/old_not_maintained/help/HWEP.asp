The 2.4GHz, 54g, Wireless-G WEP Settings screen allows you to configure
your WEP encryption settings. WEP encryption is recommended to increase
the security of your wireless network. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Default Transmit Key </span><br>
<br>
Select which WEP key (1-4) will be used when the Router sends data.
Make sure the receiving device is using the same key. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WEP Encryption</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;An acronym for Wired Equivalent Privacy, WEP is an encryption
method used to protect your wireless data communications. WEP uses
64-bit or 128-bit keys to provide access control to your network and
encryption security for every data transmission. To decode data
transmissions, all devices Wireless-G and 802.11b a network must use an
identical WEP key. <br>
<br>
Select the level of WEP encryption you wish to use, 64-bit 10 hex
digits or 128-bit 26 hex digits. Higher encryption levels offer higher
levels of security, but due to the complexity of the encryption, they
may decrease network performance. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Passphrase </span><br>
<br>
Instead of manually entering WEP keys, you can enter a Passphrase. This
Passphrase is used to generate one or more WEP keys. It is
case-sensitive and should not be longer than 16 alphanumeric
characters. (The Passphrase function is compatible with Linksys
wireless products only. If you want to communicate with non-Linksys
wireless products, you will need to enter your WEP keys manually on the
non-Linksys wireless products.) After you enter the Passphrase, click
the Generate button to create WEP keys. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Keys 1-4</span><br>
<br>
WEP keys enable you to create an encryption scheme for wireless LAN
transmissions. If you are not using a Passphrase, then manually enter a
set of values. (Do not leave a key field blank, and do not enter all
zeroes. These are not valid key values.) <br>
<br>
If you are using 64-bit WEP encryption, then each key must consist of
exactly 10 hexadecimal characters in length. If you are using 128-bit
WEP encryption, then each key must consist of exactly 26 hexadecimal
characters in length. Valid hexadecimal characters are "0"-"9" and
"A"-"F" <br>
<br>
<br>
Check all the values and click Apply to save your settings. Click
Cancel to cancel your unsaved changes.
