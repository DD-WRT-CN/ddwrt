Changes since the last public release (1.6.26):
  Control ADLER32 checking with new PNG_IGNORE_ADLER32 option.
  Removed the use of a macro containing the pre-processor 'defined'
    operator.  It is unclear whether this is valid; a macro that
    "generates" 'defined' is not permitted, but the use of the word
    "generates" within the C90 standard seems to imply more than simple
    substitution of an expression itself containing a well-formed defined
    operation.
  Added ARM support to CMakeLists.txt (Andreas Franek).
  Fixed a potential null pointer dereference in png_set_text_2() (bug report
    and patch by Patrick Keshishian).
