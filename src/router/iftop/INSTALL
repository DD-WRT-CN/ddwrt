Installation instructions for iftop

iftop is now autoconf/automake-enabled. You should be able to build it on
common platforms by typing `./configure && make'.

There is one gotcha, however, which is that some systems, such as FreeBSD,
lack a working implementation of the gethostbyaddr_r(3) C library function. On
such systems, you may want to use the --with-resolver=ares configure option to
build a version of iftop which uses the ARES asynchronous DNS library for name
resolution. An alternative is to use --with-resolver=netdb_1thread, which will
make iftop run only one name resolution thread. This is not recommended.

On some systems (notably Red Hat Linux) the libpcap header files are installed
under /usr/include/pcap; on these systems, you should manually specify this
when running configure, like this:

    $ CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/pcap ./configure


For historical interest, the old iftop makefile is included in Makefile.OLD.
