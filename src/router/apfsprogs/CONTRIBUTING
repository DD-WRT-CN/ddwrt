If you want to help with development, please submit your patches for review to
the project's mailing list at <linux-apfs@googlegroups.com>.  We try to follow
the style guidelines of the Linux kernel.

I don't own any Apple devices, so testing is needed and very appreciated.  Bug
reports should be sent to the mailing list as well.
