Apfsprogs is a suite of userland software to work with the Apple File System
on Linux. For now only mkfs and fsck tools are available, both functional but
lacking in features. Compatibility with the Apple implementations has barely
been tested; please exercise caution, and report any issues that you find to
<linux-apfs@googlegroups.com>.

A Linux kernel module for mounting the filesystem can be retrieved from
<git://github.com/eafer/linux-apfs-oot.git>. The main purpose of apfsprogs
is to assist in testing the upcoming write support.

Usage
=====

To build either the mkapfs or apfsck tool, just cd to its directory and run

  make

The resulting executable will have the name of the tool, and a man page is
available under the same directory. If you run

  make install

the files will be copied to the typical locations in the user home folder: the
binary is placed in ~/bin, and the man page in ~/share/man/man8. You can
override those paths by setting the BINDIR and MANDIR variables, for example:

  make install BINDIR=/sbin MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man8/
