.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iptraf
is an ncurses-based IP LAN monitor that generates various network statistics including TCP info, UDP counts, ICMP and OSPF information, Ethernet load info, node stats, IP checksum errors, and others.
.PP
If the 
.B iptraf 
command is issued without any command-line options, the program comes up in interactive mode, with the various facilities accessed through the main menu.

.SH OPTIONS
These options can also be supplied to the command:
.TP
.BI "\-i " iface
immediately start the IP traffic monitor on the specified interface, or
all interfaces if "\-i all" is specified
.TP
.B "\-g"
immediately start the general interface statistics
.TP
.BI "\-d " iface
allows you to immediately start the detailed on the indicated interface (iface)
.TP
.BI "\-s " iface
allows you to immediately monitor TCP and UDP traffic on the specified interface (iface)
.TP
.BI "\-z " iface
shows packet counts by size on the specified interface
.TP
.BI "\-l " iface
start the LAN station monitor on the specified interface, or all LAN
interfaces if "\-l all" is specified
.TP
.BI "\-t " timeout
tells IPTraf to run the specified facility for only
.I timeout
minutes.  This option is used only with one of the above parameters.
.TP
.B "\-B"
redirect standard output to /dev/null, closes standard input, and forks
the program into the background.  Can be used only with one of the
facility invocation parameters above.  Send the backgrounded process a
USR2 signal to terminate.
.TP
.B "\-L logfile"
allows you to specify an alternate log file name.  The default log file
name is based on either the interface selected (detailed interface
statistics, TCP/UDP service statistics, packet size breakdown), or the
instance of the facility (IP traffic monitor, LAN station monitor).  If a
path is not specified, the log file is placed in
.B /var/log/iptraf
.TP
.B "\-f"
clears all locks and counters, causing this instance of IPTraf to think
it's the first one running.  This should only be used to recover from
an abnormal termination or system crash.
.TP
.B "\-u"
allow use of unsupported interfaces as ethernet devices.  This is needed if
you changed the name of an interface (ex: ip link set eth0 name foo0)
.TP
.BI "\-q"
no longer needed, maintained only for compatibility.
.TP
.B "\-h"
shows a command summary
.SH SIGNALS

 SIGUSR1 - rotates log files while program is running
 SIGUSR2 - terminates an IPTraf process running in the background.
