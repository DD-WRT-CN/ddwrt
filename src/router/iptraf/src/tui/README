IPTraf User Interface Support Library README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the more reusable user-interface functions originally part of the
IPTraf source tree have been recoded and moved to this directory as a
support library.  This way it would be easier for interested developers to
use these functions in other programs.

Full programming information will be provided in an upcoming separate
release of this library although documentation may be provided via mail
should there be any requests for it.

Then again, there's always the IPTraf source code.

RELEASE INFORMATION

This is currently code derived from IPTraf, and is for now released under
the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.  I may
release it as a separate package soon under a less restrictive
license.  Should you be interested in this little library, and you have a
concern regarding the GPL, I can still be reached privately via
<riker@seul.org>.
