UPGRADING TO IPTRAF 3.0
-----------------------

IPTraf 3.0 is a major release.  The most significant change is a completely
redesigned IP filtering system.  Starting with IPTraf 3.0, all IP
traffic can be filtered with a unified set of filter rules, unlike previous
versions wherein separate filters had to be defined for TCP, UDP, and all
other IP traffic.  The new filter design uses a single filter for IP
traffic, which allows the user to specify, in addition to the addresses and
ports, the IP protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc) to match.

Because of the radical change in filter design, previous IPTraf filters will
no longer work with IPTraf 3.0.  Therefore the installation scripts will
simply move the old filter lists to new files, and IP filters will have to be
redefined.

NEW FILTER BEHAVIOR
-------------------

A. UNIFIED IP FILTERS

IP traffic is now filtered with a single defined filter for all IP-type
protocols (TCP, UDP, etc) unlike previous versions which used three separate
filters for TCP, UDP, and all other IP traffic.  This makes it easier to
define filters for for all IP traffic to or from a certain host or network
without having to define three distinct filters.

This redesign breaks compatibility with previous versions of IPTraf.

A. REVERSE MATCHING

Until IPTraf 3.0, TCP and UDP filters automatically matched in both
directions, for example, a filter defined to match
100.1.1.1/255.255.255.255 port 80 to 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 port 0
matched all packets flowing from host 10.1.1.1, port 80 to any host on the
network 192.168.1.0, as well as packets coming from the network
192.168.1.0 to host 100.1.1.1 port 80.

With IPTraf 3.0, this no longer is the case.  Automatic reverse matching
is done only in the IP traffic monitor's TCP window (because of TCP's
full-duplex nature), but in all other places, automatic reverse matching
is no longer done unless you set the "Match opposite" field in the filter
definition dialog boxes to Y.

The "Match opposite" fields in the filter dialog boxes allow you to match
packets flowing in the opposite direction without having to define another
filter.  This is useful for such things as ICMP echo request/echo reply
packets (pings), UDP DNS queries, and other things that come in "pairs".  
Or you can turn them off for more precise measurement of incoming and
outgoing data rates.

However as earlier stated, the "Match opposite" field in TCP filters are
ignored in the IP traffic monitor's TCP window, because reverse matching
is always performed there.

C. MISCELLANEOUS IP PROTOCOLS

The filter rule definition dialog contains some fields that match common IP
protocols.  However a longer field is provided for additional protocols 
to match.  You can enter here a comma-separated list of individual 
protocol numbers or ranges (e.g. 49, 69, 88-100, 110).

BUG FIXES
---------

IPTraf 3.0 fixes a minor bug where Token Ring interfaces' promiscuous
modes were not toggled by the Force Promiscuous configuration option.

Window borders don't appear in color when IPTraf is compiled under Red Hat
Linux 7.3, possibly others.  The window support library has been updated
to fix this problem.

Minor user interface quirks have also been fixed.

ADDITIONAL NETWORK INTERFACE SUPPORT
------------------------------------

Support for tun and brg (tunnelling and bridging) interfaces has been
added to this version.

PROTOCOL RECOGNITION
--------------------

For not-so-common IP protocols, IPTraf's IP traffic monitor looks up the 
/etc/services file to determine the protocol names.  More common protocols 
(ICMP, UDP) are looked up internally.

L2TP, IPSec Authentication, and IPSec Encrypted Payload packets have been
added to IPTraf's internal recognition.
