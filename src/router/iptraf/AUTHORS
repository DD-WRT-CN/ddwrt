Original author of iptraf:
--------------------------

	1997 - 2004	Gerard Paul Java

Since no progress was made since 2004 and the author didn't answer
any question if he will be working on iptraf anytime soon again,
Nikola Pajkovsky from RedHat took over the project in 2010 and made
a fork named iptraf-ng.
