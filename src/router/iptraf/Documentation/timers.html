>  This figure determines the amount of time (in minutes) a
  connection entry may remain idle before it becomes
  eligible for replacement by a new connection. The default is 15 minutes.
  You may want to reduce this on an isolated (not connected
  to the Internet) LAN or a LAN connected to the Internet with
  high-speed links. Just enter the new value and press
  Enter. You can press Ctrl+X to leave the current value unchanged.</P

>Screen Update Interval</A
></H2
><P
>  This value determines the rate in seconds at which the screen is
  updated. The default is 0, which means the screen is updated as fast
  as possible, giving close-to-realtime reflection
  of network activity. However, this high-speed update can cause
  incredible amounts of traffic if IPTraf is run on a remote
  terminal (e.g. a Telnet or Secure Shell session). You can set this
  to a higher value, such as 1 or 2 seconds to slow down the updates.</P
><P
>  This figure does not affect the rate of data capture. Only the
  screen refresh is affected. The figures are still updated as fast as
  possible, although the figure display will no longer be as close
  to realtime.</P
><P
>  The default setting is 0, which shouldn't be a problem on the
  console. Set it to a slightly higher value on remote terminals or slow
  links. The setting affects all monitoring facilities.</P

>   Updating the screen is one of the slowest operations in a
  program. Older versions of IPTraf had a problem once network
  activity became very high. Because each packet caused a screen update,
  IPTraf began spending more time with the screen updates, causing a loss
  of packets once network activity reached a certain point.</P
><P
>  However, since many users like rapid counts on their screen, a
  compromise was incorporated. Even when the screen update interval is set
  to 0, there is still a 50ms delay between screen updates (except the LAN
  station monitor, which has a 100 ms delay). This is still visually fast,
  but provides more time to the packet capture routine. Higher
  delays may result in better accuracy of counts and activity.</P
><P
>  In any case, this setting only affects screen updates. Capture still
  proceeds as fast as possible.</P
