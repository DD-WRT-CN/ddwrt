><P
>  IPTraf also includes a facility that generates statistics on TCP and UDP
  traffic. This facility displays counts of all TCP and UDP packets with
  source or destination ports numbered less than 1024. Ports 1 to 1023 are
  reserved for the TCP/IP application protocols (well-known ports).</P

><P
>  The statistics window indicates the protocol (TCP or UDP), the
  port number, the total packets and bytes counted for this particular
  protocol/port combination, the packets and bytes destined for that
  protocol and port, and the packets and bytes coming
  from that protocol and port.</P
><P
>  Byte counts include the IP header and payload only. The data link header
  is not included.</P
><P
>  The protocol/port indicators are color-coded for easier identification
  on color terminals. TCP indicators are in yellow, UDP in bright green.</P
><P
>  Some network applications or protocols may use port numbers higher
  than 1023. Examples
  of these include application proxy servers (HTTP proxy servers typically
  use values like 8000, 8080, 8888, and the like), and IRC
  (IRC servers commonly accept connections on ports 6660 to 6669). These
  ports are by default not included in the counts. If you do want
  to include a higher-numbered port in the statistics, you can add
  them yourself from the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
><A
HREF="config.html"
>Configure...</A
>/Additional ports...</I
> 
  menu item. See the section below.</P
><P
>  If logging is enabled, The statistics are also written to a log file
  (the default name is
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tcp_udp_services-<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>iface</I
></TT
>.log</TT
>, where iface
  is the selected interface (for example,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tcp_udp_services-eth0.log</TT
>).</P
><P
>  IPTraf computes the total, incoming, outgoing, and data rates of the
  protocol currently indicated by the facility's highlight bar. The data
  rates are indicated at the bottom of the screen. If logging is
  enabled, the average data rates since the start of the facility are
  placed in the log file.</P
><P
>  The Up and Down cursor keys move the highlight bar. Pressing X or Ctrl+X
  exits and returns to the main menu (or the shell if it was started
  from the command line).</P

>Sorting TCP/UDP Entries</A
></H2
><P
>  Pressing the S key brings up a window which allows you to
  select the field by which the entries will be sorted. You can press R to
  sort by port, P to sort by total packets, B to sort by total bytes, T to
  sort by incoming packets (packets to), O to sort by incoming bytes
  (bytes to), F to sort by outgoing packets (packets from) and M to sort
  by outgoing bytes (bytes from). Pressing any other key cancels the sort.</P
><P
>  Port numbers are sorted in ascending order (least first) but
  statistics are sorted in descending order (largest counts first).</P
><P
>  As with the IP traffic monitor, sorting is performed only with
  this sequence. Automatic sorting is not performed so as not to
  affect performance.</P
