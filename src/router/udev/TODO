These things would be nice to have:
  o log the relationship of the kernel name and the persistent disk name
    to syslog, so any error logged from the kernel can be associated with
    any of the links at that time


These things will change in future udev versions:
  o warn if BUS, ID, SYSFS are used as keys
    (they are SUBSYSTEMS, KERNELS, ATTRS now)


These things are deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future
udev version:
  o remove old udevdb dump 'udevinfo -d'
    (-e exports everything)

  o remove udevstart
    (we rely on the kernel "uevent" triggers of kernel 2.6.15 and no longer
     want to guess event properties from sysfs like udevstart is doing it)

  o remove extra for /etc/dev.d/ /etc/hotplug.d/
    (that inefficient stuff should finally go away)
