Introduction
============

nprobe is a software NetFlow v5/v9 and nFlow probe that allows to turn a PC into a NetFlow probe. It has been designed to be compact, easy to embed, an memory/CPU savvy.


NetFlow v5
==========
This is the default flow export format.


NetFlow v9
==========
In order to enable NetFlowV9 it is necessary to use the -T flag that defines the template format. For instance:
'nprobe -T "%PKTS %BYTES %TOS %IP_SRC_ADDR %IP_DST_ADDR"  -n 127.0.0.1:2055'. For the list of all supported
fields type "nprobe -h". You can visualize the generated flows using a recent version of Ethereal (www.ethereal.com).


nFlow v1
========
In order to enable nFlowV1 it is necessary to specify -T (as for NetFlowV9) and -N <key>
where key is the key used to calculate the MD5 summary.


NOTE for nprobe 2.0 Users
=========================
This version of nProbe has been re-engineered significantly.
* The hash where flows are stored is now dynamic, however you should set -w to a reasonable value for your network.
* Expired flows are checked while processing packets: no packets to process, no expired flows.
* The -s flag has now a different meaning.
