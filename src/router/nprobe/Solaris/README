This directory contains support files needed to build the package named
'nprobe-<version>-sparc-Solaris-2.<X>.pkg' for the Solaris 2.X Operating System.

To build this package, you'll need a version of the software nProbe properly
compiled and installed under its own installation directory (refer to the
--prefix option of configure script distributed with nProbe sources).
Then, you can run the 'make' command which will automatically start the build
of the package.
