	  Say Y here if you intend to attach an Atheros Cardbus or PCI
	  wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.  This
	  driver support the standard Linux Wireless Extensions.

	  You will also very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to
	  configure your card and that /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts works:
	  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called ath_pci.  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Rate control algorithms determine how the transmission rate is
	  selected based on the quality of the connection.

config ATHEROS_RATE_SAMPLE
	bool "Sample"
	help
	  SampleRate chooses the bitrate it predicts will provide the
	  most throughput based on estimates of the expected per-packet
	  transmission time for each bitrate. SampleRate periodically
	  sends packets at bitrates other than the current one to
	  estimate when another bitrate will provide better performance.
	  SampleRate switches to another bitrate when its estimated
	  per-packet transmission time becomes smaller than the current
	  bitrate's. SampleRate reduces the number of bitrates it must
	  sample by eliminating those that could not perform better than
	  the one currently being used. SampleRate also stops probing at
	  a bitrate if it experiences several successive losses.

config ATHEROS_RATE_ONOE
	bool "Onoe"
	help
	  Use Atsushi Onoe's rate control algorithm.

config ATHEROS_RATE_AMRR
	bool "AMRR"
	help
	  Adaptive Multi Rate Retry control algorithm.
