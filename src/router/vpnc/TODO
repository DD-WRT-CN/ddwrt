TODO list

* On opensolaris we need to add -interface in case the route points
  to an interface instead of a next hop, see
  http://www.cwinters.com/blog/2008/02/02/getting_vpnc_to_work_on_opensolaris.html

* Add native ESP support

* Allow PSK without xauth.

* further research into the "packet too short" messages.
  - see http://lists.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/pipermail/vpnc-devel/2005-February/000553.html
    for more information

* pass IPSEC target network to script
  - use it to initialize the tunnel interface and routes 

* clean up scripts
  - config-support for vpnc-script
  - customizable handling of routing
  - switch to disable resolv.conf rewriting
  - do $something with split_dns

* beautify paket dump output

* large code cleanup
  - at least one function per packet (instead of one function per phase)
  - factor out a central select-loop, send / receive code, nat-t handling
  - maybe even add some sort of state machine
  - get a rid of remaining (non-const) global variables

* implement phase1 rekeying (with or without xauth-reauthentication)
* implement compression
* try a list of gateways (backup server)
* Generate the manpage command line part directly from vpnc

* optionally use in-kernel-ipsec with pf-key
  - merge patch

* add support for pcap and dump decrypted traffic

* research/bugs:
  - usernames containing "@" unable to login
  - ipsec over tcp
  - nortel support?
  - segfault if > 100 routes/acls (to large paket? read size?)
    (probably "fixed" by increasing the size in r_packet in vpnc.c,
    but why did it crash?)
  - amd64 somehow broken? maybe gcc bugs??
  - some debug prints get the endianess wrong
  - In case the psk in hybrid isn't correct, the server sends annother AM_2
    packet - to port 500 of course, even if we are using nat-t and talked on
    4500 already. We currently don't handle that.

* optional drop root (rekey? reconnect? vpnc-script calls?)
  - Don't drop privileges, ever, but allow to be run suid.
  - If euid != ruid, clear out env on program start.
  - Sanitize variables for vpnc-script (snarf code from
    callscript.c from dhcpclient).
  - If euid != ruid, disable command line options (but not the profile
    parameter).
  - If euid != ruid, treat profiles as filenames only. They must not
    be paths, i.e. contain PATHSEP. Read them relative to /etc/vpnc.
  - Make sure vpnc-disconnect only kills processes owned by same user.

* implement certificate support
* implement dsa certificates in hybrid mode
* Adapt lifetime (when given as time) to certificate lifetime etc
  (rfc2401, 4.4.3)
* implement main mode for phase 1 (needed to *use* certificates in
  many cases)

* factor out crypto stuff (cipher, hmac, dh)
  - http://libtomcrypt.org/features.html
  - http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/ patch fertig
  - libgcrypt (old too?)
  - autodetect?
  - openssl??
  - relicense to gpl+ssl?

* links to packages, howtos, etc.
