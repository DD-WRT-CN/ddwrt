Subject: Messaging

In order to reduce the amount of AMI and ARI events generated,
the global "Message/ast_msg_queue" channel can be set to suppress
it's normal channel housekeeping events such as "Newexten",
"VarSet", etc. This can greatly reduce load on the manager
and ARI applications when the Digium Phone Module for Asterisk
is in use.  To enable, set "hide_messaging_ami_events" in
asterisk.conf to "yes"  In Asterisk versions <18, the default
is "no" preserving existing behavior.  Beginning with
Asterisk 18, the option will default to "yes".
