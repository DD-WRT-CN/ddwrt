This concept is known as <span>call parking</span>.</p><p>Call parking is a feature that allows a participant in a call to put the other participants on hold while they themselves hang up. When parking, the party that initiates the park will be told a parking space, which under standard configuration doubles as an extension. This extension, or parking space, serves as the conduit for accessing the parked call. At this point, as long as the parking space is known, the parked call can be retrieved from a different location/device from where it was originally answered.</p><h1 id="CallParking-CallParkingConfigurationFilesandModule">Call Parking Configuration Files and Module</h1><p>In versions of Asterisk prior to Asterisk 12, call parking was considered an Asterisk core feature and was configured using <code>
    <span>features.conf</span>
  </code>. However, Asterisk 12 underwent vast architectural changes, several of which were directed at call parking support. Because the amount of changes introduced in Asterisk 12 was quite extensive, they have been omitted from this document. For reference, you can find a comprehensive list of these changes here: <span> <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/New+in+12">New in 12</a> </span>.</p><p>In a nutshell, Asterisk 12 relocated its support for call parking from the Asterisk core into a separate, loadable module, <code>
    <span>res_parking</span>
  </code>. As a result, configuration for call parking was also moved to <code>
    <span> <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+12+Configuration_res_parking" rel="nofollow">res_parking.conf</a> </span>
  </code>. Configuration for call parking through <code>
    <span> <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+12+Configuration_features" rel="nofollow">features.conf</a> </span>
  </code> for versions of Asterisk 12 and beyond, <span>is no longer supported</span>. Additionally, support for the <code>
    <span> <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+12+Application_ParkAndAnnounce" rel="nofollow">ParkAndAnnounce</a> </span>
  </code> application was relocated to the <code>
    <span>res_parking</span>
  </code> module and the <code>
    <span>app_parkandannounce</span>
  </code> module was removed.</p><p>Before we move any further, there is one more rather important detail to address regarding configuration for <code>
    <span>res_parking</span>
  </code>:</p>    <div class="aui-message warning shadowed information-macro">
                            <span class="aui-icon icon-warning">Icon</span>
                <div class="message-content">
                            <p><span> <code>res_parking</code> uses the configuration framework. If an invalid configuration is </span> <span>supplied, <code>res_parking</code> will fail to load or fail to reload. Previously, </span> <span>invalid configurations would generally be accepted, with certain errors </span> <span>resulting in individually disabled parking lots.</span></p>
                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Now that we've covered all of that, let's look at some examples of how all this works.</p></div><div class="columnMacro"><div class="panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="panelHeader" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>On This Page</b></div><div class="panelContent">

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">res_parking.conf</span>
  </code>, <code>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">5555001</span>
  </code>. The handler will then attempt to dial the <code>

  </code> option.</p><p style="color: rgb(35,31,32);">Sadly for our caller, the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>
  </code> extension quickly redeems itself by using the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">GoTo</span>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">701</span>
  </code> extension in the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">parkedcalls</span>
  </code> context to retrieve the parked call. But, since the next thing the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>
  </code> extension does is hangup on our caller, I am beginning to think the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>

</div></div><h2 id="CallParking-CustomHandlingforCallParkingTimeouts">Custom Handling for Call Parking Timeouts</h2><p style="color: rgb(35,31,32);">Finally, we will move on to explain how to handle situations where upon a parked call session timing out, it is not desired to return to the parked call to the device from where the call was originally parked. (This might be handy for situations where you have a dedicated receptionist or service desk extension to handle incoming call traffic.) Just like the previous two examples, this is a basic scenario that only requires minimal adjustments to the following configuration files: <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">res_parking.conf</span>
  </code>, <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">features.conf</span>
  </code>, and <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">extensions.conf</span>
  </code>.</p><p style="color: rgb(35,31,32);">Like before, our dialplan contains an extension to accept calls from the outside. Again, let's assume that the extension the caller dialed was: <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">5555001</span>
  </code>. The handler will then attempt to dial the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>
  </code> extension, using the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">k</span>
  </code> option.</p><p style="color: rgb(35,31,32);">Sadly for our caller, the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>
  </code> extension answers the call and immediately sends the DTMF digits to invoke the call parking feature without giving the caller a chance to speak. Just like in the previous scenario, the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>
  </code> extension does not retrieve the parked call. Maybe the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">alice</span>
  </code> extension is having a bad day.</p><p style="color: rgb(35,31,32);">After a period of <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">300 seconds</span>
  </code>, or <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 minutes</span>
  </code> (as defined in the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">parkingtime</span>
  </code> option in <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">res_parking.conf</span>
  </code>), the call will time out. Because we told Asterisk to send a timed-out parked call to the <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">parkedcallstimeout</span>
  </code> context (<code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">comebacktoorigin=no</span>
  </code>), we are able to bypass the default logic that directs Asterisk to returning the call to the person who initiated the park. In our example, when a parked call enters our <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">s</span>
  </code> extension in our <code>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">parkedcallstimeout</span>
  </code> context, we only play a sound file to the caller and hangup the call, but this is where you could do any custom logic like returning the call to a different extension, or performing a lookup of some sort.</p><p style="color: rgb(35,31,32);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In summary:</span></p><ul><li>Outside caller dials <code>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">5555001</span>
    </code></li><li>Alice picks up the device and says &quot;Hello World!&quot;</li><li>Alice presses the one touch parking DTMF combination</li><li>The parked call times out after 300 seconds</li><li>Asterisk sends the call to the <code>

    </code> extension in our <code>
