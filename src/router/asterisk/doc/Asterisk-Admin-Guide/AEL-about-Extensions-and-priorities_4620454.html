                    <p>A Context contains zero or more Extensions. There are several predefined extensions. The &quot;s&quot; extension is the &quot;start&quot; extension, and when a device activates a context the &quot;s&quot; extension is the one that is going to be run. Other extensions are the timeout &quot;t&quot; extension, the invalid response, or &quot;i&quot; extension, and there's a &quot;fax&quot; extension. For instance, a normal call will activate the &quot;s&quot; extension, but an incoming FAX call will come into the &quot;fax&quot; extension, if it exists. (BTW, asterisk can tell it's a fax call by the little &quot;beep&quot; that the calling fax machine emits every so many seconds.).</p>

<p>Extensions contain several priorities, which are individual instructions to perform. Some are as simple as setting a variable to a value. Others are as complex as initiating the Voicemail application, for instance. Priorities are executed in order. </p>

<p>When the 's&quot; extension completes, asterisk waits until the timeout for a response. If the response matches an extension's pattern in the context, then control is transferred to that extension. Usually the responses are tones emitted when a user presses a button on their phone. For instance, a context associated with a desk phone might not have any &quot;s&quot; extension. It just plays a dialtone until someone starts hitting numbers on the keypad, gather the number, find a matching extension, and begin executing it. That extension might Dial out over a connected telephone line for the user, and then connect the two lines together. </p>

<p>The extensions can also contain &quot;goto&quot; or &quot;jump&quot; commands to skip to extensions in other contexts. Conditionals provide the ability to react to different stimuli, and there you have it.</p>
