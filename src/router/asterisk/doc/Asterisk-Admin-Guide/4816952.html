                    <p>When a station goes off hook, it should initiate a call to Asterisk with the extension that indicates that the phone went off hook without specifying a specific line. In the examples in this document, for the station named &quot;station1&quot;, this extension is simply named, &quot;station1&quot;. </p>

<p>Asterisk will attempt to connect this station to the first available trunk that is not in use. Asterisk will check the trunks in the order that they were specified in the station entry in sla.conf. If all trunks are in use, the call will be denied. </p>

<p>If Asterisk is able to acquire an idle trunk for this station, then trunk is connected to the station and the station will hear dialtone. The station can then proceed to dial a number to call. As soon as a trunk is acquired, all appearances of this line on stations will show that the line is in use.</p>
