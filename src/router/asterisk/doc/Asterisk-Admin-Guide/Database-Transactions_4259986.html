                    <p>As of 1.6.2, Asterisk now supports doing database transactions from the Dialplan.  A number of new applications and functions have been introduced for this purpose and this document should hopefully familiarize you with all of them.</p>

<p>First, the <code>ODBC()</code> function has been added which is used to set up all new database transactions.  Simply write the name of the transaction to this function, along with the arguments of &quot;transaction&quot; and the database name, e.g. <code>Set(ODBC(transaction,postgres-asterisk)=foo)</code>.  In this example, the name of the transaction is &quot;foo&quot;.  The name doesn't really matter, unless you're manipulating multiple transactions within the same dialplan, at the same time.  Then, you use the transaction name to change which transaction is active for the next dialplan function.</p>

<p>The <code>ODBC()</code> function is also used to turn on a mode known as <code>forcecommit</code>.  For most cases, you won't need to use this, but it's there.  It simply causes a transaction to be committed, when the channel hangs up.  The other property which may be set is the <code>isolation</code> property.  Please consult with your database vendor as to which values are supported by their ODBC driver.  Asterisk supports setting all standard ODBC values, but many databases do not support the entire complement.</p>

<p>Finally, when you have run multiple statements on your transaction and you wish to complete the transaction, use the <code>ODBC_Commit</code> and <code>ODBC_Rollback</code> applications, along with the transaction ID (in the example above, &quot;foo&quot;) to commit or rollback the transaction.  Please note that if you do not explicitly commit the transaction or if <code>forcecommit</code> is not turned on, the transaction will be automatically rolled back at channel destruction (after hangup) and all related database resources released back to the pool.</p>
