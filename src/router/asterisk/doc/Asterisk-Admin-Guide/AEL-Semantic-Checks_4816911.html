                    <p>AEL, after parsing, but before compiling, traverses the dialplan tree, and makes several checks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Macro calls to non-existent macros.</li>
	<li>Macro calls to contexts.</li>
	<li>Macro calls with argument count not matching the definition.</li>
	<li>application call to macro. (missing the '&amp;')</li>
	<li>application calls to &quot;GotoIf&quot;, &quot;GotoIfTime&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, &quot;endwhile&quot;, &quot;Random&quot;, and &quot;execIf&quot;, will generate a message to consider converting the call to AEL goto, while, etc. constructs.</li>
	<li>goto a label in an empty extension.</li>
	<li>goto a non-existent label, either a within-extension, within-context, or in a different context, or in any included contexts. Will even check &quot;sister&quot; context references.</li>
	<li>All the checks done on the time values in the dial plan, are done on the time values in the ifTime() and includes times: o the time range has to have two times separated by a dash; o the times have to be in range of 0 to 24 hours. o The weekdays have to match the internal list, if they are provided; o the day of the month, if provided, must be in range of 1 to 31; o the month name or names have to match those in the internal list.</li>
	<li>(0.5) If an expression is wrapped in $[ ... ], and the compiler will wrap it again, a warning is issued.</li>
	<li>(0.5) If an expression had operators (you know, +,-,,/,issued. Maybe someone forgot to wrap a variable name?*</li>
	<li>(0.12) check for duplicate context names.</li>
	<li>(0.12) check for abstract contexts that are not included by any context.</li>
	<li>(0.13) Issue a warning if a label is a numeric value.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a subset of checks that have been removed until the proposed AAL (Asterisk Argument Language) is developed and incorporated into Asterisk. These checks will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(if the application argument analyzer is working: the presence of the 'j' option is reported as error.</li>
	<li>if options are specified, that are not available in an application.</li>
	<li>if you specify too many arguments to an application.</li>
	<li>a required argument is not present in an application call.</li>
	<li>Switch-case using &quot;known&quot; variables that applications set, that does not cover all the possible values. (a &quot;default&quot; case will solve this problem. Each &quot;unhandled&quot; value is listed.</li>
	<li>a Switch construct is used, which is uses a known variable, and the application that would set that variable is not called in the same extension. This is a warning only...</li>
	<li>Calls to applications not in the &quot;applist&quot; database (installed in /var/lib/asterisk/applist&quot; on most systems).</li>
	<li>In an assignment statement, if the assignment is to a function, the function name used is checked to see if it one of the currently known functions. A warning is issued if it is not.</li>
</ul>
