                    <p>The Asterisk community is a large group of individuals, representing many nations, ethnicities, ages, technical professions and specialities.Â  Working together on Asterisk can be a challenge with so many differing perspectives and backgrounds. Therefore to ensure the community is healthy, happy, and stress-free, participants in the Asterisk project agree to adhere to the following Community Code of Conduct.</p><p>Note that by joining and/or participating in the Asterisk community, you are agreeing that you accept and will adhere to the rules listed below, even if you do not explicitly state so.</p><h1 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-AcceptableBehaviour">Acceptable Behaviour</h1><h2 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-Beconsiderate">Be considerate</h2><ul><li>Experience levels vary. Don't assume that someone can understand your particular explanation.</li><li>Keep in mind that English is a second language for many users.</li></ul><h2 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-Berespectful">Be respectful</h2><ul><li>It is possible to strongly disagree without using harsh language or resorting to derogatory comments. If you disagree with someone, disagree with the argument, not the character of the person.</li><li>Remember that everyone is entitled to an opinion.</li></ul><h2 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-Askforhelp">Ask for help</h2><ul><li>If you don't know how to proceed with an aspect of development or documentation, ask for help! Always read the documentation, but don't be afraid to ask &quot;silly&quot; questions.</li><li>When asking for help, take advantage of the resources that are available to you, including the <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">wiki</a>, <a href="http://lists.digium.com/mailman/listinfo/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">mailing list archives</a>, and <a href="http://asteriskdocs.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Asterisk: The Definitive Guide</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-Takeresponsibility">Take responsibility</h2><ul><li>If you did something wrong, apologize to the affected. Do your best to fix the issue and, if you can't, ask for help!</li><li>If someone does take responsibility, be considerate.</li></ul><h2 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-Givecredit">Give credit</h2><ul><li>Give proper credit to everyone involved In any contribution to the project, be it documentation, tests, code, or anything in between.</li><li>If someone fails to give adequate contribution, gently remind them while being considerate. Assume that the omission was accidental, not malicious.</li></ul><h1 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-UnacceptableBehaviour">Unacceptable Behaviour</h1><p>The Asterisk project reserves the right to take action in safe-guarding the community from those that participate in unacceptable behaviour. Unacceptable behaviour involves:</p><ul><li>Flaming - Arguing in a disrespectful way, attacking the character of others, rabidly ranting about things you dislike and refusing to drop the topic.</li><li>Trolling - Intentionally baiting others into flaming or heated arguments for the sake of argument or drama itself.</li><li>Mean-spirited or offensive talk - This could be combinations of the above, being rude, vulgar, and generally offensive to others.</li></ul><p>In general, if community moderators and administrators are receiving many complaints about your behaviour, then you are likely doing something wrong. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.</p><p>Consequences to bad behaviour may involve bans from communication forums or channels and restrictions on privileges within the community.</p><p>Complaints about members behaviour or appeals in regards to bans or loss of privilege can be sent to <a href="mailto:asteriskteam@digium.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">asteriskteam@digium.com</a>.</p><h1 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-OpenCommunity">Open Community</h1><p>We invite anybody, from any company, locale, or even other projects to participate in the Asterisk project. Our community is open, and contribution is welcome. Diversity makes a project strong, and we are proud to include anyone who wants to collaborate with others in a respectful fashion.</p><h1 id="AsteriskCommunityCodeofConduct-ProjectLeadership">Project Leadership</h1><p>The role of project leadership is handled by the founders of the Asterisk project, <a href="https://www.sangoma.com/open-source/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Digium Inc</a>.
