                    <p>The Asterisk project takes the issue of its users security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Asterisk, please follow the steps on this wiki page to report the security vulnerability to the Asterisk Development Team.</p>    <div class="aui-message problem shadowed information-macro">

                            <p>The <a href="https://issues.asterisk.org/jira" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Asterisk Issue Tracker</a> is a public site, and all bug reports against Asterisk can be viewed openly by the public. While this results in a transparent, open process - which is good - reporting a security vulnerability on the issue tracker without properly selecting the &quot;Security&quot; issue type makes the entire Asterisk user community vulnerable.</p><p>The &quot;Security&quot; issue type will automatically lock down the issue so it can only be viewed by the reporter and bug marshals. If you have any difficulties with that we'll help; please follow the instructions here and e-mail the team at <a href="mailto:security@asterisk.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">security@asterisk.org.</a></p>

<h1 id="AsteriskSecurityVulnerabilities-ReportingaSecurityVulnerability">Reporting a Security Vulnerability</h1><ol><li>Send an e-mail to the Asterisk Development Team by e-mailing <a href="mailto:security@asterisk.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">security@asterisk.org.</a> Include the following:<ol><li>A summary of the suspected vulnerability, e.g., 'Remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the FOO channel driver'</li><li>A detailed explanation of how the vulnerability can be exploited and/or reproduced. Test drivers/cases that can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability are highly appreciated.</li></ol></li><li>A developer will respond to your inquiry. If you'd like, e-mails can be signed and/or encrypted.</li><li>Once the developer confirms the security vulnerability is discussed and confirmed you will be asked to create an issue on the Asterisk issue tracker of type &quot;Security&quot;. <strong>You must use a &quot;Security&quot; issue type or the information will be publicly disclosed.</strong></li></ol><p>Security vulnerabilities are treated seriously by the developer community, and the Asterisk Development Team always attempts to address vulnerabilities in a timely fashion. Sometimes, external influences may impact when a security release can be made; feel free to e-mail the developer assigned to the issue or <a href="mailto:security@asterisk.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">security@asterisk.org</a> to discuss the schedule for a security release for your issue.</p><h1 id="AsteriskSecurityVulnerabilities-PastSecurityVulnerabilities">Past Security Vulnerabilities</h1><p>Past security vulnerability reports are available on the <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/downloads/security-advisories" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">asterisk.org web site</a> and on the <a href="http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Asterisk downloads</a> site.</p><p>All security vulnerabilities are also issued a CVE number and can be queried in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">CVE</a> database.</p><h1 id="AsteriskSecurityVulnerabilities-ParticipatinginSecurityIssues">Participating in Security Issues</h1><p>All Asterisk Developers who have commit access are welcome to participate in the development of solutions to security issues. Security issues can be viewed in JIRA using the label <code>Security</code>:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="theme: Confluence; brush: java; gutter: false" style="font-size:12px;">project=ASTERISK and labels=Security</pre>
</div></div><p>When a new security issue is created, an e-mail will be sent to the asterisk-dev mailing list notifying the community of the issue. This e-mail will not contain any information about the vulnerability, and will merely contain a link to the new security issue.</p><p>When a patch is ready to be peer reviewed on Gerrit, a review will be created using the review project Security-asterisk. This project is not normally visible to Gerrit users, is invite only, and generates no e-mails to the asterisk-dev mailing list. Users who have the Bug Marshal permission in JIRA are invited to participate in the review process.</p>    <div class="aui-message problem shadowed information-macro">

                            <p>Please exercise caution when participating in security issues. It is far better to 'test' a reply or message on an issue, e-mail, or review than to leak information.</p>
                    </div>
    </div>
<p>Once the patch has been peer reviewed, it should <strong>not</strong> be committed. Committing the patch must be coordinated as an overall security release. This is typically handled by the affected branch maintainers.</p>
