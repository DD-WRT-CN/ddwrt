<p> </p><p> </p><p>If you're able to get the command-line examples above working, feel free to skip this section. Otherwise, let's look at troubleshooting connections to the Asterisk CLI.</p><p>The most common problem that people encounter when learning the Asterisk command-line interface is that sometimes they're not able to connect to the Asterisk service running in the background. For example, let's say that Fred starts the Asterisk service, but then isn't able to connect to it with the CLI:</p><div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<pre>[root@server ~]# service asterisk start
Starting asterisk:                                         [  OK  ]
[root@server ~]# asterisk -r

=========================================================================
Unable to connect to remote asterisk (does /var/run/asterisk/asterisk.ctl exist?)
</pre>
</div></div><p>What does this mean? It most likely means that Asterisk did not remain running between the time that the service was started and the time Fred tried to connect to the CLI (even if it was only a matter of a few seconds.) This could be caused by a variety of things, but the most common is a broken configuration file.</p><p>To diagnose Asterisk start-up problems, we'll start Asterisk in a special mode, known as <strong>console</strong> mode. In this mode, Asterisk does not run as a background service or daemon, but instead runs directly in the console. To start Asterisk in console mode, pass the <strong>-c</strong> parameter to the <strong>asterisk</strong> application. In this case, we also want to turn up the verbosity, so we can see any error messages that might indicate why Asterisk is unable to start.</p><div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
