                    <h1 id="WritingaPythonTest-Overview">Overview</h1><p>While the Asterisk Test Suite can execute a test written in any scripting language, <a href="http://www.python.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Python</a>Â has become the de facto language of choice. The Asterisk Test Suite contains a number of modules written in Python to help with writing tests; as such, we strongly encourage people to make use of the existing infrastructure - and, of course - add to it as necessary!</p><p>The following walkthrough produces a test similar to the <em>tests/skeleton_test</em>, which is included in the Asterisk Test Suite and provides a template for a Python test. You can use that test as a starting point for tests that you write.</p><p>Developing a test can be broken down into the following steps:</p><ol><li>Define the <a href="#WritingaPythonTest-TestLayoutandAsteriskConfiguration">#Test Layout and Asterisk Configuration</a></li><li>Describe the test in <a href="#WritingaPythonTest-DescribingthetestinTest-Config.yaml">Test-Config.yaml</a></li><li>Write the <a href="#WritingaPythonTest-Writingrun-test">run-test</a> script</li><li><a href="#WritingaPythonTest-Runningthetest">Execute</a> the test</li></ol><p>This walkthrough will create a test (<em>sample</em>) that makes Asterisk playback tt-monkeys.</p><h1 id="WritingaPythonTest-TestLayoutandAsteriskConfiguration">Test Layout and Asterisk Configuration</h1><ol><li>Create a new folder for the test in the appropriate location. In general, this will be a folder in the <em>/tests</em> directory. You may want to provide a similar structure to Asterisk by grouping related tests together, e.g., application tests should have folder(s) under the <em>/tests/apps</em> directory. For now, we'll assume that we're creating a test called <em>sample</em>, located in <em>tests/sample</em>.</li><li>In the <em>sample</em> folder, create the following:<ul><li>A <em>run-test</em> file, which will contain the python script to execute. The file should have execute permissions, and should not have the &quot;.py&quot; extension. The Test Suite looks for files named run-test and executes them; the fact that we are choosing Python as our language is an implementation decision that the Test Suite does not care about.</li><li><em>test-config.yaml</em>, which will contain the test information and its dependency properties</li><li>A <em>configs</em> directory. The <em>configs</em> directory should contain subfolder(s) for each instance of Asterisk that will be instantiated by the test, named <em>ast#</em>, where # is the 1-based index of the Asterisk instance. For now, create a single folder named <em>ast1</em>.</li><li><p>In each <em>ast#</em> subfolder, the Asterisk config files needed for the test. At a minimum, this will be <em>extensions.conf</em>.</p>    <div class="aui-message hint shadowed information-macro">

</div></div><h1 id="WritingaPythonTest-Writingrun-test">Writing run-test</h1><p>Now we start to actually write the meat of our test. Each test in the Test Suite is spawned as a separate process, and so each test needs an entry point. First, lets import a few libraries and write our main.</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="theme: Confluence; brush: python; gutter: true" style="font-size:12px;">#!/usr/bin/env python
# vim: sw=3 et:
import sys
import os
import logging

from twisted.internet import reactor

sys.path.append(&quot;lib/python&quot;)
from asterisk.test_case import TestCase

LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Main entry point for the test.  This will do the following:
    1. Instantiate the test object
    2. Tell the test object to start the Asterisk instances
    3. Run the twisted reactor.  This will automatically call the test&#39;s run method when twisted is up and start the instances of Asterisk, and block until the twisted reactor exits.
    4. Check results.  If the test passed, return 0; otherwise, return any other value (usually 1).  The top level script checks the return code from the process it spawned to determine whether or not the test passed or failed.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    test = SampleTest()
    reactor.run()

    if not test.passed:
        return 1

    return 0

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
   sys.exit(main() or 0)
</pre>
</div></div><p>There are a few things to note from this:</p><ul><li>We're going to use the twisted reactor for our test. This is usually useful as we typically will use asynchronous AMI events to drive the tests.</li><li>We've told the python path where the Test Suite libraries are, and imported the TestCase class. Our test case class, SampleTest, will end up deriving from it.</li><li>We have a logging object we can use to send statements to the Test Suite log file</li></ul><p>Moving on!</p><h2 id="WritingaPythonTest-DefiningtheTestClass">Defining the Test Class</h2><p>We'll need a test the inherits from TestCase. For now, we'll assume that the basic class provides our start_asterisk and stop_asterisk methods and that we don't need to override them (which is a safe assumption in most cases). We'll fill in some of these methods a bit more later.</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="theme: Confluence; brush: python; gutter: true" style="font-size:12px;">class SampleTest(TestCase):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A class that executes a very simple test, using TestCase to do most of the
    heavy lifting.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    def __init__(self):
        super(SampleTest, self).__init__()
        &quot;&quot;&quot; You should always call the base class implementation of __init__ prior
        to initializing your test conditions here.  Some useful variables the TestCase
        class provides:
         - passed - set to False initially.  Set to True if your test passes.
         - ast - a list of Asterisk instance
         - ami - a list of StarPY manager (AMI) instances, corresponding to each Asterisk instance
         - reactor_timeout - maximum time a test can execute before it is considered to fail.  This
             prevents tests from hanging and never finishing.  You can reset this timer using a call
             to TestCase.reset_timeout

        In your initialization, you should usually set the reactor_timeout if it should
        be something other than 30 (the default).  You should also call create_asterisk, which
        will create and initialize the Asterisk instances.  You can specify as a parameter the number
        of Asterisk instances to create.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        self.create_asterisk()

    def run(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Run is called by the reactor when the test starts.  It is the entry point for test execution,
        and will occur after Asterisk is started (so long as the instructions in this example are followed).
        Typically, after calling the base class implementation, connections over AMI are created.  You
        can also interact with the started Asterisk instances here by referencing the ast list.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        super(SampleTest, self).run()


        # Create a connection over AMI to the created Asterisk instance.  If you need to communicate with
        # all of the instances of Asterisk that were created, specify the number of AMI connections to make.
        # When the AMI connection succeeds, ami_connect will be called.
        self.create_ami_factory()

    def ami_connect(self, ami):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        This method is called by the StarPY manager class when AMI connects to Asterisk.

        Keyword Arguments:
        ami    -    The StarPY manager object that connected
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
</div></div><p>At the end of this, we have the following:</p><ul><li>A class that inherits from <em>TestCase</em>. In its constructor, it calls the base class constructor and creates an instance of Asterisk by calling the <em>TestCase.create_asterisk()</em> method. The base class provides us a few attributes that are of particular use:<ul><li><em>passed</em> - a boolean variable that we can set to True or False</li><li><em>ast</em> - a list of asterisk instances, that provide access to a running Asterisk application</li><li><em>ami</em> - a list of AMI connections corresponding to each asterisk instance</li><li><em>reactor_timeout</em> - the amount of time (in seconds) that the twisted reactor will wait before it stops itself. This is used to prevent tests from hanging.</li><li><em>TestCase</em> has a method we can call called <em>create_asterisk()</em>, that, well, creates instances of Asterisk. Yay!</li><li><em>TestCase</em> has another method we can call called <em>create_ami_factory()</em> that creates AMI connections to our previously created instances of Asterisk. We do this after the twisted reactor has started, so that Asterisk has a chance to start up.</li></ul></li><li>An entry point for the twisted reactor called <em>run()</em>. This calls the base class's implementation of the method, then spawns an AMI connection. Note that in our <em>main</em> method, we start up the created Asterisk instances prior to starting the twisted reactor - so when <em>run()</em> is called by twisted, Asterisk should already be started and ready for an AMI connection.</li><li>A method, <em>ami_connect</em>, that is called when an AMI connection succeeds. This same method is used for all AMI connections - so to tell which AMI connection you are receiving, we can check the <em>ami.id</em> property. Each AMI connection corresponds exactly to the instance of Asterisk in the <em>ast</em> list - so <em>ast[ami.id]</em> will reference the Asterisk instance associated with the <em>ami</em> object.</li></ul><h2 id="WritingaPythonTest-MakingtheTestdosomething">Making the Test do something</h2><p>So, we have a test that will start up, spawn an instance of Asterisk, and connect to it over AMI. That's interesting, but doesn't really test anything. Based on our <em>extensions.conf</em>, we want to call the <em>s</em> extension in <em>default</em>, hopefully have monkeys possess our channel, and then check that the <em>UserEvent</em> fired off to determine if we passed. If we don't see the UserEvent, we should eventually fail. Lets start off by adding some code to <em>ami_connect</em>.</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

</div></div><p>What we've now instructed the test to do is, upon an AMI connection, originate a call to the <em>s</em> extension in context <em>default</em>, using a Local channel. starpy's <em>originate</em> method returns a deferred object, which lets us assign a callback handler in case of an error. We've used the TestCase class's <em>handleOriginateFailure</em> method for this, which will automagically fail our test for us if the originate fails.</p><p>Now we need something to handle the UserEvent when monkeys inevitably enslave our phone system. Let's add that to our <em>ami_connect</em> method as well.</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

</div></div><p>Now we've registered for the UserEvent that should be raised from the dialplan after monkeys are played back. We make the assumption in the handler that we could have other UserEvents that return failure results - in our case, we don't have failure scenarios, but many tests do.

import logging

from twisted.internet import reactor

sys.path.append(&quot;lib/python&quot;)
from asterisk.test_case import TestCase

LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class SampleTest(TestCase):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A class that executes a very simple test, using TestCase to do most of the
    heavy lifting.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    def __init__(self):
        super(SampleTest, self).__init__()
        &quot;&quot;&quot; You should always call the base class implementation of __init__ prior
        to initializing your test conditions here.  Some useful variables the TestCase
        class provides:
         - passed - set to False initially.  Set to True if your test passes.
         - ast - a list of Asterisk instance
         - ami - a list of StarPY manager (AMI) instances, corresponding to each Asterisk instance
         - reactor_timeout - maximum time a test can execute before it is considered to fail.  This
             prevents tests from hanging and never finishing.  You can reset this timer using a call
             to TestCase.reset_timeout

        In your initialization, you should usually set the reactor_timeout if it should
        be something other than 30 (the default).  You should also call create_asterisk, which
        will create and initialize the Asterisk instances.  You can specify as a parameter the number
        of Asterisk instances to create.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        self.create_asterisk()

    def run(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Run is called by the reactor when the test starts.  It is the entry point for test execution,
        and will occur after Asterisk is started (so long as the instructions in this example are followed).
        Typically, after calling the base class implementation, connections over AMI are created.  You
        can also interact with the started Asterisk instances here by referencing the ast list.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        super(SampleTest, self).run()

        # Create a connection over AMI to the created Asterisk instance.  If you need to communicate with
        # all of the instances of Asterisk that were created, specify the number of AMI connections to make.
        # When the AMI connection succeeds, ami_connect will be called.
        self.create_ami_factory()

    def ami_connect(self, ami):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        This method is called by the StarPY manager class when AMI connects to Asterisk.

        Keyword Arguments:
        ami    -    The StarPY manager object that connected
        &quot;&quot;&quot;

        ami.registerEvent(&#39;UserEvent&#39;, self.user_event)

        LOGGER.info(&quot;Instructing monkeys to rise up and overthrow their masters&quot;)
        deferred = ami.originate(channel=&quot;Local/s@default&quot;,
                                 application=&quot;Echo&quot;)
        deferred.addErrback(self.handle_originate_failure)

    def user_event(self, ami, event):
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
      Handler for the AMI UserEvent
      Keyword Arguements:
      ami     -     The StarPY AMI object corresponding to the received UserEvent
      event   -     The AMI event
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
      if event[&#39;userevent&#39;] != &#39;TestResult&#39;:
         return

      if event[&#39;result&#39;] == &quot;pass&quot;:
         self.passed = True
         LOGGER.info(&quot;Monkeys detected; test passes!&quot;)
      else:
         LOGGER.error(&quot;No monkeys found :-(&quot;)
      self.stop_reactor()


def main():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Main entry point for the test.  This will do the following:
    1. Instantiate the test object
    2. Tell the test object to start the Asterisk instances
    3. Run the twisted reactor.  This will automatically call the test&#39;s run method when twisted is up and start the instances of Asterisk, and block until the twisted reactor exits.
    4. Check results.  If the test passed, return 0; otherwise, return any other value (usually 1).  The top level script checks the return code from the process it spawned to determine whether or not the test passed or failed.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    test = SampleTest()
    reactor.run()

    if not test.passed:
        return 1

    return 0

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
   sys.exit(main() or 0)
