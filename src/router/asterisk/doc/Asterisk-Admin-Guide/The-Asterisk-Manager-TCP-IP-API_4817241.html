                    <p>The manager is a client/server model over TCP. With the manager interface, you'll be able to control the PBX, originate calls, check mailbox status, monitor channels and queues as well as execute Asterisk commands. </p>

<p>AMI is the standard management interface into your Asterisk server. You configure AMI in manager.conf. By default, AMI is available on TCP port 5038 if you enable it in manager.conf. </p>

<p>AMI receive commands, called &quot;actions&quot;. These generate a &quot;response&quot; from Asterisk. Asterisk will also send &quot;Events&quot; containing various information messages about changes within Asterisk. Some actions generate an initial response and data in the form list of events. This format is created to make sure that extensive reports do not block the manager interface fully. </p>

<p>Management users are configured in the configuration file manager.conf and are given permissions for read and write, where write represents their ability to perform this class of &quot;action&quot;, and read represents their ability to receive this class of &quot;event&quot;. <br />
If you develop AMI applications, treat the headers in Actions, Events and Responses as local to that particular message. There is no cross-message standardization of headers. </p>

<p>If you develop applications, please try to reuse existing manager headers and their interpretation. If you are unsure, discuss on the asterisk-dev mailing list. </p>

<p>Manager subscribes to extension status reports from all channels, to be able to generate events when an extension or device changes state. The level of details in these events may depend on the channel and device configuration. Please check each channel configuration file for more information. (in sip.conf, check the section on subscriptions and call limits)</p>
