Within this file one is able to configure Asterisk to log messages to files and/or a syslog and even to the Asterisk console.  Note, the sections and descriptions listed below are meant to be informational and act as a guide (a &quot;how to&quot;) when configuring logging in Asterisk.  Options with stated defaults don't have to be explicitly set as they will simply default to a designated value.</p><h2 id="LoggingConfiguration-GeneralSection:">General Section:</h2><div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">

; Customize the display of debug message time stamps
; this example is the ISO 8601 date format (yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS)
;
; see strftime(3) Linux manual for format specifiers.  Note that there is
; also a fractional second parameter which may be used in this field.  Use
; %1q for tenths, %2q for hundredths, etc.
;
dateformat = %F %T.%3q   ; ISO 8601 date format with milliseconds

; Write callids to log messages (defaults to yes)
use_callids = yes

; Append the hostname to the name of the log files (defaults to no)
appendhostname = no

; Log queue events to a file (defaults to yes)
queue_log = yes

; Always log queue events to a file, even when a realtime backend is
; present (defaults to no).
queue_log_to_file = no

; Set the queue_log filename (defaults to queue_log)
queue_log_name = queue_log

; When using realtime for the queue log, use GMT for the timestamp
; instead of localtime.  (defaults to no)
queue_log_realtime_use_gmt = no

; Log rotation strategy (defaults to sequential):
; none:  Do not perform any log rotation at all.  You should make
;        very sure to set up some external log rotate mechanism
;        as the asterisk logs can get very large, very quickly.
; sequential:  Rename archived logs in order, such that the newest
;              has the highest sequence number.  When
;              exec_after_rotate is set, ${filename} will specify
;              the new archived logfile.
; rotate:  Rotate all the old files, such that the oldest has the
;          highest sequence number (this is the expected behavior
;          for Unix administrators).  When exec_after_rotate is
;          set, ${filename} will specify the original root filename.
; timestamp:  Rename the logfiles using a timestamp instead of a
;             sequence number when &quot;logger rotate&quot; is executed.
;             When exec_after_rotate is set, ${filename} will
;             specify the new archived logfile.
rotatestrategy = rotate

; Run a system command after rotating the files.  This is mainly
; useful for rotatestrategy=rotate. The example allows the last
; two archive files to remain uncompressed, but after that point,
; they are compressed on disk.
exec_after_rotate=gzip -9 ${filename}.2

<pre>[logfiles]
; File names can either be relative to the standard Asterisk log directory (see &quot;astlogdir&quot; in
; asterisk.conf), or absolute paths that begin with &#39;/&#39;.
;
; A few file names have been reserved and are considered special, thus cannot be used and will
; not be considered as a regular file name.  These include the following:
;
;    syslog - logs to syslog facility
;    console - logs messages to the Asterisk root console.
;
; For each file name given a comma separated list of logging &quot;level&quot; types should be specified
; and include at least one of the following (in no particular order):
;    debug
;    notice
;    warning
;    error
;    dtmf
;    fax
;    security
;    verbose(&lt;level&gt;)
;
; The &quot;verbose&quot; value can take an optional integer argument that indicates the maximum level
; of verbosity to log at.  Verbose messages with higher levels than the indicated level will
; not be logged to the file.  If a verbose level is not given, verbose messages are logged
; based upon the current level set for the root console.
;
; The special character &quot;*&quot; can also be specified and represents all levels, even dynamic
; levels registered by modules after the logger has been initialized.  This means that loading
; and unloading modules that create and remove dynamic logging levels will result in these
; levels being included on filenames that have a level name of &quot;*&quot;, without any need to
; perform a &quot;logger reload&quot; or similar operation.
;
; Note, there is no value in specifying both &quot;*&quot; and specific level types for a file name.
; The &quot;*&quot; level means ALL levels.  The only exception is if you need to specify a specific
; verbose level. e.g, &quot;verbose(3),*&quot;.
;
; It is highly recommended that you DO NOT turn on debug mode when running a production system
; unless you are in the process of debugging a specific issue.  Debug mode outputs a LOT of
; extra messages and information that can and do fill up log files quickly. Most of these
; messages are hard to interpret without an understanding of the underlying code.  Do NOT report
; debug messages as code issues, unless you have a specific issue that you are attempting to debug.
; They are messages for just that -- debugging -- and do not rise to the level of something that
; merit your attention as an Asterisk administrator.  

; output notices, warnings and errors to the console
console =&gt; notice,warning,error

; output security messages to the file named &quot;security&quot;
security =&gt; security

; output notices, warnings and errors to the the file named &quot;messages&quot;
messages =&gt; notice,warning,error

; output notices, warnings, errors, verbose, dtmf, and fax to file name &quot;full&quot;
full =&gt; notice,warning,error,verbose,dtmf,fax

; output notices, warning, and errors to the syslog facility
syslog.local0 =&gt; notice,warning,error
