</div></div><p>This should build DAHDI, libss7, and Asterisk with SS7 support.</p>
                    </div>
    </div>
<p>In the past, there was a special asterisk-ss7 branch to use which contained the SS7 code. That code has been merged back into the trunk version of Asterisk, and the old asterisk-ss7 branch has been deprecated and removed. If you are still using the asterisk-ss7 branch, it will not work against the current version of libss7, and you should switch to asterisk-trunk instead.</p><h5 id="SignalingSystemNumber7-Configuration:">Configuration:</h5><p>In /etc/dahdi/system.conf, your signalling channel(s) should be a &quot;dchan&quot; and your bearers should be set as &quot;bchan&quot;.</p><p>The sample chan_dahdi.conf contains sample configuration for setting up an E1 link.</p><p>In brief, here is a simple ss7 linkset setup:</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="theme: Confluence; brush: java; gutter: false" style="font-size:12px;">signalling = ss7
ss7type = itu 		; or ansi if you are using an ANSI link

linkset = 1		; Pick a number for your linkset identifier in chan_dahdi.conf

pointcode = 28		; The decimal form of your point code.  If you are using an
			; ANSI linkset, you can use the xxx-xxx-xxx notation for
			; specifying your link
adjpointcode = 2	; The point code of the switch adjacent to your linkset

defaultdpc = 3		; The point code of the switch you want to send your ISUP
			; traffic to.  A lot of the time, this is the same as your
			; adjpointcode.

; Now we configure our Bearer channels (CICs)

cicbeginswith = 1	; Number to start counting the CICs from.  So if DAHDI/1 to
			; DAHDI/15 are CICs 1-15, you would set this to 1 before you
			; declare channel=1-15

channel=1-15		; Use DAHDI/1-15 and assign them to CICs 1-15

cicbeginswith = 17	; Now for DAHDI/17 to DAHDI/31, they are CICs 17-31 so we initialize
			; cicbeginswith to 17 before we declare those channels

channel = 17-31		; This assigns CICs 17-31 to channels 17-31

sigchan = 16		; This is where you declare which DAHDI channel is your signalling
			; channel.  In our case it is DAHDI/16.  You can add redundant
			; signalling channels by adding additional sigchan= lines.
			
; If we want an alternate redundant signalling channel add this

sigchan = 48		; This would put two signalling channels in our linkset, one at
			; DAHDI/16 and one at DAHDI/48 which both would be used to send/receive
			; ISUP traffic.

; End of chan_dahdi.conf
</pre>
</div></div><p>This is how a basic linkset is setup. For more detailed chan_dahdi.conf SS7 config information as well as other options available for that file, see the default chan_dahdi.conf that comes with the samples in asterisk. If you would like, you can do a `make samples` in your asterisk-trunk directory and it will install a sample chan_dahdi.conf for you that contains<br /> more information about SS7 setup.</p><p>For more information, you can ask questions of the community on the asterisk-ss7 or asterisk-dev mailing lists.</p>
