                    <p>The asterisk expression parser has undergone some evolution. It is hoped that the changes will be viewed as positive. </p>

<p>The &quot;original&quot; expression parser had a simple, hand-written scanner, and a simple bison grammar. This was upgraded to a more involved bison grammar, and a hand-written scanner upgraded to allow extra spaces, and to generate better error diagnostics. This upgrade required bison 1.85, and part of the user community felt the pain of having to upgrade their bison version. </p>

<p>The next upgrade included new bison and flex input files, and the makefile was upgraded to detect current version of both flex and bison, conditionally compiling and linking the new files if the versions of flex and bison would allow it. </p>

<p>If you have not touched your extensions.conf files in a year or so, the above upgrades may cause you some heartburn in certain circumstances, as several changes have been made, and these will affect asterisk's behavior on legacy extension.conf constructs. The changes have been engineered to minimize these conflicts, but there are bound to be problems. </p>

<p>The following list gives some (and most likely, not all) of areas of possible concern with &quot;legacy&quot; extension.conf files:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Tokens separated by space(s). Previously, tokens were separated by spaces. Thus, ' 1 + 1 ' would evaluate to the value '2', but '1+1' would evaluate to the string '1+1'. If this behavior was depended on, then the expression evaluation will break. '1+1' will now evaluate to '2', and something is not going to work right. To keep such strings from being evaluated, simply wrap them in double quotes: ' &quot;1+1&quot; '</li>
	<li>The colon operator. In versions previous to double quoting, the colon operator takes the right hand string, and using it as a regex pattern, looks for it in the left hand string. It is given an implicit Ã´perator at the beginning, meaning the pattern will match only at the beginning of the left hand string. If the pattern or the matching string had double quotes around them, these could get in the way of the pattern match. Now, the wrapping double quotes are stripped from both the pattern and the left hand string before applying the pattern. This was done because it recognized that the new way of scanning the expression doesn't use spaces to separate tokens, and the average regex expression is full of operators that the scanner will recognize as expression operators. Thus, unless the pattern is wrapped in double quotes, there will be trouble. For instance, ${VAR1} : (WhoWhat)+ may have have worked before, but unless you wrap the pattern in double quotes now, look out for trouble! This is better: &quot;${VAR1}&quot; : &quot;(WhoWhat*)+&quot; and should work as previous.*</li>
	<li>Variables and Double Quotes Before these changes, if a variable's value contained one or more double quotes, it was no reason for concern. It is now !</li>
	<li>LE, GE, NE operators removed. The code supported these operators, but they were not documented. The symbolic operators, =, =, and != should be used instead.</li>
	<li>Added the unary '-' operator. So you can 3+ -4 and get -1.</li>
	<li>Added the unary '!' operator, which is a logical complement. Basically, if the string or number is null, empty, or '0', a '1' is returned. Otherwise a '0' is returned.</li>
	<li>Added the '=~' operator, just in case someone is just looking for match anywhere in the string. The only diff with the ':' is that match doesn't have to be anchored to the beginning of the string.</li>
	<li>Added the conditional operator 'expr1 ? true_expr :: false_expr' First, all 3 exprs are evaluated, and if expr1 is false, the 'false_expr' is returned as the result. See above for details.</li>
	<li>Unary operators '-' and '!' were made right associative.</li>
</ol>
