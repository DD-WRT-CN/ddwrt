                    <p>When a line button is pressed on a station, the station should initiate a call to Asterisk with the extension that indicates which line button was pressed. In the examples given in this document, for a station named &quot;station1&quot; and a trunk named &quot;line1&quot;, the extension would be &quot;station1_line1&quot;. <br />
If the specified trunk is not in use, then the station will be connected to it and will hear dialtone. All appearances of this trunk will then show that it is now in use. </p>

<p>If the specified trunk is on hold by this station, then this station will be reconnected to the trunk. The line appearance for this trunk on this station will now show in use. If this was the only station that had the call on hold, then all appearances of this trunk will now show that it is in use. Otherwise, all stations that are not currently connected to this trunk will show it on hold. </p>

<p>If the specified trunk is on hold by a different station, then this station will be connected to the trunk only if the trunk itself and the station(s) that have it on hold do not have private hold enabled. If connected, the appeareance of this trunk on this station will then show in use. All stations that are not currently connected to this trunk will show it on hold.</p>
