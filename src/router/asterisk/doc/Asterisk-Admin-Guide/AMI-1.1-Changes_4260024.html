<h5 id="AMI1.1Changes-NEWEVENTS">NEW EVENTS</h5>

<div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<pre>- Event: FullyBooted
	Modules: loader.c
	Purpose:
		It is handy to have a single event notification for when all Asterisk
		modules have been loaded--especially for situations like running
		automated tests. This event will fire 1) immediately upon all modules
		loading or 2) upon connection to the AMI interface if the modules have
		already finished loading before the connection was made. This ensures
		that a user will never miss getting a FullyBooted event. In vary rare
		circumstances, it might be possible to get two copies of the message
		if the AMI connection is made right as the modules finish loading.
	Example:
		Event: FullyBooted
		Privilege: system,all
		Status: Fully Booted

- Event: Transfer
	Modules: res_features, chan_sip
	Purpose:
		Inform about call transfer, linking transferer with transfer target
		You should be able to trace the call flow with this missing piece
		of information. If it works out well, the &quot;Transfer&quot; event should
		be followed by a &quot;Bridge&quot; event
		The transfermethod: header informs if this is a pbx core transfer
		or something done on channel driver level. For SIP, check the example:
	Example:
		
		Event: Transfer
		Privilege: call,all
		TransferMethod: SIP
		TransferType: Blind
		Channel: SIP/device1-01849800
		SIP-Callid: 091386f505842c87016c4d93195ec67d@127.0.0.1
		TargetChannel: SIP/device2-01841200
		TransferExten: 100
		TransferContext: default

- Event: ChannelUpdate
	Modules: chan_sip.c, chan_iax2.c
	Purpose:
		Updates channel information with ID of PVT in channel driver, to
		be able to link events on channel driver level.
		* Integrated in SVN trunk as of May 4th, 2007

	Example:

		Event: ChannelUpdate
		Privilege: system,all
		Uniqueid: 1177271625.27
		Channel: SIP/olle-01843c00
		Channeltype: SIP
		SIPcallid: NTQzYWFiOWM4NmE0MWRkZjExMzU2YzQ3OWQwNzg3ZmI.
		SIPfullcontact: sip:olle@127.0.0.1:49054

- Event: NewAccountCode
	Modules: cdr.c
	Purpose: To report a change in account code for a live channel
	Example:
		Event: NewAccountCode
		Privilege: call,all
		Channel: SIP/olle-01844600
		Uniqueid: 1177530895.2
		AccountCode: Stinas account 1234848484
		OldAccountCode: OllesAccount 12345

- Event: ModuleLoadReport
	Modules: loader.c
	Purpose: To report that module loading is complete. Some aggressive
		clients connect very quickly to AMI and needs to know when
		all manager events embedded in modules are loaded
		Also, if this does not happen, something is seriously wrong.
		This could happen to chan_sip and other modules using DNS.
	Example:
		Event: ModuleLoad
		ModuleLoadStatus: Done
		ModuleSelection: All
		ModuleCount: 24

- Event: QueueSummary
	Modules: app_queue
	Purpose: To report a summary of queue information. This event is generated by
		issuing a QueueSummary AMI action.
	Example:
		Event: QueueSummary
		Queue: Sales
		LoggedIn: 12
		Available: 5
		Callers: 10
		HoldTime: 47
	If an actionID was specified for the QueueSummary action, it will be appended as the
	last line of the QueueSummary event.

- Event: AgentRingNoAnswer
	Modules: app_queue
	Purpose: Reports when a queue member was rung but there was no answer.
	Example:
		Event: AgentRingNoAnswer
		Queue: Support
		Uniqueid: 1177530895.2
		Channel: SIP/1000-53aee458
		Member: SIP/1000
		MemberName: Thaddeus McClintock
		Ringtime: 10

- Event: RegistryEntry
	Modules: chan_sip
	Purpose: Reports the state of the SIP registrations. This event is generated by
                issuing a QueueSummary AMI action.
		The RegistrationTime header is expressed as epoch.
	Example:
		Event: RegistryEntry
		Host: sip.myvoipprovider.com
		Port: 5060
		Username: guestuser
		Refresh: 105
		State: Registered
		RegistrationTime: 1219161830
	If an actionID was specified for the SipShowRegistry action, it will be appended as the
	last line of the RegistrationsComplete event.

- Event: ChanSpyStart
	Modules: app_chanspy
	Purpose: Reports when an active channel starts to be monitored by someone.
	Example:
		Event: ChanSpyStart
		SpyerChannel: SIP/4321-13bba124
		SpyeeChannel: SIP/1234-56ecc098

- Event: ChanSpyStop
	Modules: app_chanspy
	Purpose: Reports when an active channel stops to be monitored by someone.
	Example:
		Event: ChanSpyStop
		SpyeeChannel: SIP/1234-56ecc098
