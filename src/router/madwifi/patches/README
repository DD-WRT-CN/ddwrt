This directory contains the bits needed to integrate the Madwifi source
distribution into a Linux kernel source tree.  To do this, unpack the
kernel source if needed, then run the install.sh script from this
directory.

If you want to patch the currently running system you can run install.sh
without arguments, otherwise specify the source tree location on the
command line:

./install.sh /usr/src/linux

The driver sources will be copies into drivers/net/wireless/madwifi and
some kernel files will be patched to know about this directory.

Now you can run "make menuconfig" or similar command and configure the
driver using the normal mechanisms.  If the kernel is already configured,
run "make oldconfig" to skip the questions you have already answered.

If you want to build modules, it's recommended that you use the
standalone build rather than integrate the driver into the kernel.  Use
integrated build to compile Madwifi into the kernel.  However, it's
possible to build Madwifi modules when the driver is integrated into a
2.6.x kernel.
