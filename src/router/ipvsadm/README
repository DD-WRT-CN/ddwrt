ipvsadm

This is free software.  See below for details.

ipvsadm is a utility to administer the IP Virtual Server (IPVS)
services offered by the Linux kernel with IPVS support to create a
wide range of load-balancer setups.

Check out the Linux Virtual Server Project home page on the
World Wide Web:
	http://www.LinuxVirtualServer.org/
	or
	http://www.Linux-VS.org/
for the most recent information about ipvsadm.

Releases can be downloaded from:
 https://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ipvsadm/

The source code is available via git from kernel.org:
 https://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/kernel/ipvsadm/ipvsadm.git
 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/ipvsadm/ipvsadm.git

A wikipage is available at:
 http://kb.linuxvirtualserver.org/wiki/Main_Page

To make, make sure your Linux kernel is compiled with IPVS, e.g. by invoking
"make menuconfig" or "make xconfig" to setup the right compiling options, 
see the README of the virtual server patch for detail, then simply type
	make
in the source directory.

Install to your liking.  We suggest the following pathnames:
	/sbin/ipvsadm
	/sbin/ipvsadm-save
	/sbin/ipvsadm-restore
	/usr/man/man8/ipvsadm.8
	/usr/man/man8/ipvsadm-save.8
	/usr/man/man8/ipvsadm-restore.8
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipvsadm
This will be done automatically when calling
	make install
in the source directory.
