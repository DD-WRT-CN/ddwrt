>Once installed, RedBoot will operate fairly generically. However,
there are some features that can be configured for a particular installation.
These depend primarily on whether flash and/or networking support are available. The remainder
of this discussion assumes that support for both of these options is included
in RedBoot.</P

>Each node in a networked
system needs to have a unique address. Since the network support in RedBoot
is based on TCP/IP, this address
is an IP (Internet Protocol) address. There are two ways for a system to &#8220;know&#8221;
its IP address. First, it can be stored locally on the platform. This is known
as having a static IP address. Second, the system can use the network itself
to discover its IP address. This is known as a dynamic IP address. RedBoot
supports this dynamic IP address mode by use of the BOOTP (a subset of DHCP) protocol. In this case, RedBoot will ask the network (actually
some generic server on the network) for the IP address to use.</P

also be supported, but such support will be limited to additional data items,

>The choice of IP
address type is made via the <B

the platform.</P

that is, IP address and other data to hosts on a network. It does this in
different ways. Next, there can be a fixed relationship between a certain
node and the data, based on that node&#8217;s unique Ethernet Station Address
(ESA, sometimes called a MAC address). The other possibility is simply to
assign addresses that are free. The sample DHCP configuration file shown does
both. Refer to the DHCP documentation for more details.</P

>RedBoot cannot communicate with
machines on different subnets because it does not support routing. It always
assumes that it can get to an address directly, therefore it always tries
to ARP and then send packets directly to that unit. This means that whatever
it talks to must be on the same subnet. If you need to talk to a host on a
different subnet (even if it's on the same &#8216;wire&#8217;), you need to
go through an ARP proxy, providing that there is a Linux box connected to
the network which is able to route to the TFTP server. For example: <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<VAR
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
