.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
As \fBgcj\fR is just another front end to \fBgcc\fR, it supports many

options specific to \fBgcj\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.Sh "Input and output files"
.IX Subsection "Input and output files"
A \fBgcj\fR command is like a \fBgcc\fR command, in that it
consists of a number of options and file names.  The following kinds
of input file names are supported:
.Ip "\fIfile\fR\fB.java\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.java"
Java source files.
.Ip "\fIfile\fR\fB.class\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.class"
Java bytecode files.
.Ip "\fIfile\fR\fB.zip\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.zip"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fIfile\fR\fB.jar\fR" 4
.IX Item "file.jar"
.PD
An archive containing one or more \f(CW\*(C`.class\*(C'\fR files, all of
which are compiled.  The archive may be compressed.
.Ip "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
A file containing a whitespace-separated list of input file names.
(Currently, these must all be \f(CW\*(C`.java\*(C'\fR source files, but that
may change.)
Each named file is compiled, just as if it had been on the command line.

.Ip "\fB\-l\fR\fIlibname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-llibname"
.PD
Libraries to use when linking.  See the \fBgcc\fR manual.
.PP
You can specify more than one input file on the \fBgcj\fR command line,
in which case they will all be compiled.  If you specify a
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-o \f(CI\s-1FILENAME\s0\f(CW\*(C'\fR
option, all the input files will be compiled together, producing a
single output file, named \fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR.
This is allowed even when using \f(CW\*(C`\-S\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR,
but not when using \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-resource\*(C'\fR.
(This is an extension beyond the what plain \fBgcc\fR allows.)
(If more than one input file is specified, all must currently
be \f(CW\*(C`.java\*(C'\fR files, though we hope to fix this.)
.Sh "Input Options"
.IX Subsection "Input Options"
\&\fBgcj\fR has options to control where it looks to find files it needs.
For instance, \fBgcj\fR might need to load a class that is referenced
by the file it has been asked to compile.  Like other compilers for the
Java language, \fBgcj\fR has a notion of a \fIclass path\fR.  There are
several options and environment variables which can be used to
manipulate the class path.  When \fBgcj\fR looks for a given class, it
searches the class path looking for matching \fI.class\fR or
\&\fI.java\fR file.  \fBgcj\fR comes with a built-in class path which
points at the installed \fIlibgcj.jar\fR, a file which contains all the
standard classes.
.PP
In the below, a directory or path component can refer either to an
actual directory on the filesystem, or to a \fI.zip\fR or \fI.jar\fR
file, which \fBgcj\fR will search as if it is a directory.
.Ip "\fB\-I\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Idir"
All directories specified by \f(CW\*(C`\-I\*(C'\fR are kept in order and prepended
to the class path constructed from all the other options.  Unless
compatibility with tools like \f(CW\*(C`javac\*(C'\fR is important, we recommend
always using \f(CW\*(C`\-I\*(C'\fR instead of the other options for manipulating the
class path.
.Ip "\fB\*(--classpath=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "classpath=path"
This sets the class path to \fIpath\fR, a colon-separated list of paths
(on Windows-based systems, a semicolon-separate list of paths).
This does not override the builtin (``boot'') search path.
.Ip "\fB\*(--CLASSPATH=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "CLASSPATH=path"
Deprecated synonym for \f(CW\*(C`\-\-classpath\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\fB\*(--bootclasspath=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "bootclasspath=path"
Where to find the standard builtin classes, such as \f(CW\*(C`java.lang.String\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\fB\*(--extdirs=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "extdirs=path"
For each directory in the \fIpath\fR, place the contents of that
directory at the end of the class path.
.Ip "\fB\s-1CLASSPATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CLASSPATH"
This is an environment variable which holds a list of paths.
.PP
The final class path is constructed like so:
.Ip "\(bu" 4
First come all directories specified via \f(CW\*(C`\-I\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
If \fB\*(--classpath\fR is specified, its value is appended.
Otherwise, if the \f(CW\*(C`CLASSPATH\*(C'\fR environment variable is specified,
then its value is appended.
Otherwise, the current directory (\f(CW\*(C`"."\*(C'\fR) is appended.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
If \f(CW\*(C`\-\-bootclasspath\*(C'\fR was specified, append its value.
Otherwise, append the built-in system directory, \fIlibgcj.jar\fR.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
Finally, if \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extdirs\*(C'\fR was specified, append the contents of the
specified directories at the end of the class path.  Otherwise, append
the contents of the built-in extdirs at \f(CW\*(C`$(prefix)/share/java/ext\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The classfile built by \fBgcj\fR for the class \f(CW\*(C`java.lang.Object\*(C'\fR
(and placed in \f(CW\*(C`libgcj.jar\*(C'\fR) contains a special zero length
attribute \f(CW\*(C`gnu.gcj.gcj\-compiled\*(C'\fR. The compiler looks for this
attribute when loading \f(CW\*(C`java.lang.Object\*(C'\fR and will report an error
if it isn't found, unless it compiles to bytecode (the option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-fforce\-classes\-archive\-check\*(C'\fR can be used to override this
behavior in this particular case.)
.Ip "\fB\-fforce-classes-archive-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fforce-classes-archive-check"
This forces the compiler to always check for the special zero length
attribute \f(CW\*(C`gnu.gcj.gcj\-compiled\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`java.lang.Object\*(C'\fR and
issue an error if it isn't found.
.Sh "Encodings"
.IX Subsection "Encodings"
The Java programming language uses Unicode throughout.  In an effort to
integrate well with other locales, \fBgcj\fR allows \fI.java\fR files
to be written using almost any encoding.  \fBgcj\fR knows how to
convert these encodings into its internal encoding at compile time.
.PP
You can use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-encoding=\f(CI\s-1NAME\s0\f(CW\*(C'\fR option to specify an
encoding (of a particular character set) to use for source files.  If
this is not specified, the default encoding comes from your current
locale.  If your host system has insufficient locale support, then
\&\fBgcj\fR assumes the default encoding to be the \fB\s-1UTF-8\s0\fR encoding
of Unicode.
.PP
To implement \f(CW\*(C`\-\-encoding\*(C'\fR, \fBgcj\fR simply uses the host
platform's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR conversion routine.  This means that in practice
\&\fBgcj\fR is limited by the capabilities of the host platform.
.PP
The names allowed for the argument \f(CW\*(C`\-\-encoding\*(C'\fR vary from platform
to platform (since they are not standardized anywhere).  However,
\&\fBgcj\fR implements the encoding named \fB\s-1UTF-8\s0\fR internally, so if
you choose to use this for your source files you can be assured that it
will work on every host.
.Sh "Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Warnings"
\&\fBgcj\fR implements several warnings.  As with other generic
\&\fBgcc\fR warnings, if an option of the form \f(CW\*(C`\-Wfoo\*(C'\fR enables a
warning, then \f(CW\*(C`\-Wno\-foo\*(C'\fR will disable it.  Here we've chosen to
document the form of the warning which will have an effect \*(-- the
default being the opposite of what is listed.
.Ip "\fB\-Wredundant-modifiers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-modifiers"
With this flag, \fBgcj\fR will warn about redundant modifiers.  For
instance, it will warn if an interface method is declared \f(CW\*(C`public\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-Wextraneous-semicolon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wextraneous-semicolon"
This causes \fBgcj\fR to warn about empty statements.  Empty statements
have been deprecated.
.Ip "\fB\-Wno-out-of-date\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-out-of-date"
This option will cause \fBgcj\fR not to warn when a source file is
newer than its matching class file.  By default \fBgcj\fR will warn
about this.
.Ip "\fB\-Wunused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused"
This is the same as \fBgcc\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-Wunused\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
This is the same as \f(CW\*(C`\-Wredundant\-modifiers \-Wextraneous\-semicolon
\&\-Wunused\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "Code Generation"
.IX Subsection "Code Generation"
In addition to the many \fBgcc\fR options controlling code generation,
\&\fBgcj\fR has several options specific to itself.
.Ip "\fB\*(--main=\fR\fI\s-1CLASSNAME\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "main=CLASSNAME"
This option is used when linking to specify the name of the class whose
\&\f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR method should be invoked when the resulting executable is
run.  [1]
.Ip "\fB\-D\fR\fIname\fR\fB[=\fR\fIvalue\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Dname[=value]"
This option can only be used with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-main\*(C'\fR.  It defines a system
property named \fIname\fR with value \fIvalue\fR.  If \fIvalue\fR is not
specified then it defaults to the empty string.  These system properties
are initialized at the program's startup and can be retrieved at runtime
using the \f(CW\*(C`java.lang.System.getProperty\*(C'\fR method.
.Ip "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
This option is used to tell \fBgcj\fR to generate bytecode
(\fI.class\fR files) rather than object code.
.Ip "\fB\*(--resource\fR \fIresource-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "resource resource-name"
This option is used to tell \fBgcj\fR to compile the contents of a
given file to object code so it may be accessed at runtime with the core
protocol handler as \fBcore:/\fR\fIresource-name\fR.  Note that
\&\fIresource-name\fR is the name of the resource as found at runtime; for
instance, it could be used in a call to \f(CW\*(C`ResourceBundle.getBundle\*(C'\fR.
The actual file name to be compiled this way must be specified
separately.
.Ip "\fB\-d\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d directory"
When used with \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR, this causes all generated \fI.class\fR files
to be put in the appropriate subdirectory of \fIdirectory\fR.  By
default they will be put in subdirectories of the current working
directory.
.Ip "\fB\-fno-bounds-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-bounds-check"
By default, \fBgcj\fR generates code which checks the bounds of all
array indexing operations.  With this option, these checks are omitted, which
can improve performance for code that uses arrays extensively.  Note that this 
can result in unpredictable behavior if the code in question actually does 
violate array bounds constraints.  It is safe to use this option if you are 
sure that your code will never throw an \f(CW\*(C`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-fno-store-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-store-check"
Don't generate array store checks.  When storing objects into arrays, a runtime
check is normally generated in order to ensure that the object is assignment
compatible with the component type of the array (which may not be known
at compile-time).  With this option, these checks are omitted.  This can 
improve performance for code which stores objects into arrays frequently.
It is safe to use this option if you are sure your code will never throw an 
\&\f(CW\*(C`ArrayStoreException\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\fB\-fjni\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fjni"
With \fBgcj\fR there are two options for writing native methods: \s-1CNI\s0
and \s-1JNI\s0.  By default \fBgcj\fR assumes you are using \s-1CNI\s0.  If you are
compiling a class with native methods, and these methods are implemented
using \s-1JNI\s0, then you must use \f(CW\*(C`\-fjni\*(C'\fR.  This option causes
\&\fBgcj\fR to generate stubs which will invoke the underlying \s-1JNI\s0
methods.
.Ip "\fB\-fno-assert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-assert"
Don't recognize the \f(CW\*(C`assert\*(C'\fR keyword.  This is for compatibility
with older versions of the language specification.
.Ip "\fB\-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization"
When the optimization level is greater or equal to \f(CW\*(C`\-O2\*(C'\fR,
\&\fBgcj\fR will try to optimize the way calls into the runtime are made
to initialize static classes upon their first use (this optimization
isn't carried out if \f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR was specified.) When compiling to native
code, \f(CW\*(C`\-fno\-optimize\-static\-class\-initialization\*(C'\fR will turn this
optimization off, regardless of the optimization level in use.
.Sh "Configure-time Options"
.IX Subsection "Configure-time Options"
Some \fBgcj\fR code generations options affect the resulting \s-1ABI\s0, and
so can only be meaningfully given when \f(CW\*(C`libgcj\*(C'\fR, the runtime
package, is configured.  \f(CW\*(C`libgcj\*(C'\fR puts the appropriate options from
this group into a \fBspec\fR file which is read by \fBgcj\fR.  These
options are listed here for completeness; if you are using \f(CW\*(C`libgcj\*(C'\fR
then you won't want to touch these options.
.Ip "\fB\-fuse-boehm-gc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-boehm-gc"
This enables the use of the Boehm \s-1GC\s0 bitmap marking code.  In particular
this causes \fBgcj\fR to put an object marking descriptor into each
vtable.
.Ip "\fB\-fhash-synchronization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fhash-synchronization"
By default, synchronization data (the data used for \f(CW\*(C`synchronize\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`wait\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`notify\*(C'\fR) is pointed to by a word in each object.
With this option \fBgcj\fR assumes that this information is stored in a
hash table and not in the object itself.
.Ip "\fB\-fuse-divide-subroutine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-divide-subroutine"
On some systems, a library routine is called to perform integer
division.  This is required to get exception handling correct when
dividing by zero.
.Ip "\fB\-fcheck-references\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-references"
On some systems it's necessary to insert inline checks whenever
accessing an object via a reference.  On other systems you won't need
this because null pointer accesses are caught automatically by the
processor.
.SH "FOOTNOTES"
.IX Header "FOOTNOTES"
.Ip "1." 4
The linker by default looks for a global function named
\&\f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  Since Java does not have global functions, and a
collection of Java classes may have more than one class with a
\&\f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR method, you need to let the linker know which of those
\&\f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR methods it should invoke when starting the application.
