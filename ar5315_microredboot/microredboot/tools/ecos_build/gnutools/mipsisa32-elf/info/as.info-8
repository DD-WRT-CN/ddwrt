Differences to `mmixal'
-----------------------

   The binutils `as' and `ld' combination has a few differences in
function compared to `mmixal' (*note mmixsite::).

   The replacement of a symbol with a GREG-allocated register (*note
GREG-base::) is not handled the exactly same way in `as' as in
`mmixal'.  This is apparent in the `mmixal' example file `inout.mms',
where different registers with different offsets, eventually yielding
the same address, are used in the first instruction.  This type of
difference should however not affect the function of any program unless
it has specific assumptions about the allocated register number.

   Line numbers (in the `mmo' object format) are currently not
supported.

   Expression operator precedence is not that of mmixal: operator
precedence is that of the C programming language.  It's recommended to
use parentheses to explicitly specify wanted operator precedence
whenever more than one type of operators are used.

   The serialize unary operator `&', the fractional division operator
`//', the logical not operator `!' and the modulus operator `%' are not
available.

   Symbols are not global by default, unless the option
`--globalize-symbols' is passed.  Use the `.global' directive to
globalize symbols (*note Global::).

   Operand syntax is a bit stricter with `as' than `mmixal'.  For
example, you can't say `addu 1,2,3', instead you must write `addu
$1,$2,3'.

   You can't LOC to a lower address than those already visited (i.e.
"backwards").

   A LOC directive must come before any emitted code.

   Predefined symbols are visible as file-local symbols after use.  (In
the ELF file, that is--the linked mmo file has no notion of a file-local
symbol.)

   Some mapping of constant expressions to sections in LOC expressions
is attempted, but that functionality is easily confused and should be
avoided unless compatibility with `mmixal' is required.  A LOC
expression to `0x2000000000000000' or higher, maps to the `.data'
section and lower addresses map to the `.text' section (*note
MMIX-loc::).

   The code and data areas are each contiguous.  Sparse programs with
far-away LOC directives will take up the same amount of space as a
contiguous program with zeros filled in the gaps between the LOC
directives.  If you need sparse programs, you might try and get the
wanted effect with a linker script and splitting up the code parts into
sections (*note Section::).  Assembly code for this, to be compatible
with `mmixal', would look something like:
      .if 0
      LOC away_expression
      .else
      .section away,"ax"
      .fi
   `as' will not execute the LOC directive and `mmixal' ignores the
lines with `.'.  This construct can be used generally to help
compatibility.

   Symbols can't be defined twice-not even to the same value.

   Instruction mnemonics are recognized case-insensitive, though the
`IS' and `GREG' pseudo-operations must be specified in upper-case
characters.

   There's no unicode support.

   The following is a list of programs in `mmix.tar.gz', available at
<http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html>, last
checked with the version dated 2001-08-25 (md5sum
c393470cfc86fac040487d22d2bf0172) that assemble with `mmixal' but do
not assemble with `as':

`silly.mms'
     LOC to a previous address.

`sim.mms'
     Redefines symbol `Done'.

`test.mms'
     Uses the serial operator `&'.

Assembler Directives
--------------------

   The PDP-11 version of `as' has a few machine dependent assembler
directives.

PDP-11 Assembly Language Syntax
-------------------------------

   `as' supports both DEC syntax and BSD syntax.  The only difference
is that in DEC syntax, a `#' character is used to denote an immediate
constants, while in BSD syntax the character for this purpose is `$'.

   eneral-purpose registers are named `r0' through `r7'.  Mnemonic
alternatives for `r6' and `r7' are `sp' and `pc', respectively.

   Floating-point registers are named `ac0' through `ac3', or
alternatively `fr0' through `fr3'.

   Comments are started with a `#' or a `/' character, and extend to
the end of the line.  (FIXME: clash with immediates?)

   The SH also has these control registers:

`pr'
     procedure register (holds return address)

`pc'
     program counter

`mach'
`macl'
     high and low multiply accumulator registers

Addressing Modes
................

   `as' understands the following addressing modes for the SH.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.

`RN'
     Register direct

`@RN'
     Register indirect

`@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`@(R0, RN)'
     Register indexed

`@(DISP, GBR)'
     `GBR' offset

`@(R0, GBR)'
     GBR indexed

`ADDR'
`@(DISP, PC)'
     PC relative address (for branch or for addressing memory).  The
     `as' implementation allows you to use the simpler form ADDR
     anywhere a PC relative address is called for; the alternate form
     is supported for compatibility with other assemblers.

`#IMM'
     Immediate data

SH Machine Directives
---------------------

`uaword'
`ualong'
     `as' will issue a warning when a misaligned `.word' or `.long'
     directive is used.  You may use `.uaword' or `.ualong' to indicate
     that the value is intentionally misaligned.

Opcodes
-------

   For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Hitachi Micro Systems, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because `as' supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to `bar'
from the program counter:

     mov.l  @(DISP, PC)

   Here is a summary of SH opcodes:

Options
-------

`-isa=shmedia | -isa=shcompact'
     Specify the default instruction set.  `SHmedia' specifies the
     32-bit opcodes, and `SHcompact' specifies the 16-bit opcodes
     compatible with previous SH families.  The default depends on the
     ABI selected; the default for the 64-bit ABI is SHmedia, and the
     default for the 32-bit ABI is SHcompact.  If neither the ABI nor
     the ISA is specified, the default is 32-bit SHcompact.

     Note that the `.mode' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ISA is not
     specified on the command line.

`-abi=32 | -abi=64'
     Specify the default ABI.  If the ISA is specified and the ABI is
     not, the default ABI depends on the ISA, with SHmedia defaulting
     to 64-bit and SHcompact defaulting to 32-bit.

     Note that the `.abi' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ABI is not
     specified on the command line.  When the ABI is specified on the
     command line, any `.abi' pseudo-ops in the source must match it.

`-shcompact-const-crange'
     Emit code-range descriptors for constants in SHcompact code
     sections.

`-no-mix'
     Disallow SHmedia code in the same section as constants and
     SHcompact code.

`-no-expand'
     Do not expand MOVI, PT, PTA or PTB instructions.

`-expand-pt32'
     With -abi=64, expand PT, PTA and PTB instructions to 32 bits only.

Register Names
..............

   You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r63' to refer to
the SH64 general registers, `cr0' through `cr63' for control registers,
`tr0' through `tr7' for target address registers, `fr0' through `fr63'
for single-precision floating point registers, `dr0' through `dr62'
(even numbered registers only) for double-precision floating point
registers, `fv0' through `fv60' (multiples of four only) for
single-precision floating point vectors, `fp0' through `fp62' (even
numbered registers only) for single-precision floating point pairs,
`mtrx0' through `mtrx48' (multiples of 16 only) for 4x4 matrices of
single-precision floating point registers, `pc' for the program
counter, and `fpscr' for the floating point status and control register.

   You can also refer to the control registers by the mnemonics `sr',
`ssr', `pssr', `intevt', `expevt', `pexpevt', `tra', `spc', `pspc',
`resvec', `vbr', `tea', `dcr', `kcr0', `kcr1', `ctc', and `usr'.


File: as.info,  Node: SH64-Addressing,  Prev: SH64-Regs,  Up: SH64 Syntax

Addressing Modes
................

   SH64 operands consist of either a register or immediate value.  The
immediate value can be a constant or label reference (or portion of a
label reference), as in this example:

     	movi	4,r2
     	pt	function, tr4
     	movi	(function >> 16) & 65535,r0
     	shori	function & 65535, r0
     	ld.l	r0,4,r0

   Instruction label references can reference labels in either SHmedia
or SHcompact.  To differentiate between the two, labels in SHmedia
sections will always have the least significant bit set (i.e. they will
be odd), which SHcompact labels will have the least significant bit
reset (i.e. they will be even).  If you need to reference the actual
address of a label, you can use the `datalabel' modifier, as in this
example:

     	.long	function
     	.long	datalabel function

   In that example, the first longword may or may not have the least
significant bit set depending on whether the label is an SHmedia label
or an SHcompact label.  The second longword will be the actual address
of the label, regardless of what type of lable it is.

SH64 Machine Directives
-----------------------

   In addition to the SH directives, the SH64 provides the following
directives:

`.mode [shmedia|shcompact]'
`.isa [shmedia|shcompact]'
     Specify the ISA for the following instructions (the two directives
     are equivalent).  Note that programs such as `objdump' rely on
     symbolic labels to determine when such mode switches occur (by
     checking the least significant bit of the label's address), so
     such mode/isa changes should always be followed by a label (in
     practice, this is true anyway).  Note that you cannot use these
     directives if you didn't specify an ISA on the command line.

`.abi [32|64]'
     Specify the ABI for the following instructions.  Note that you
     cannot use this directive unless you specified an ABI on the
     command line, and the ABIs specified must match.

`.uaquad'
     Like .uaword and .ualong, this allows you to specify an
     intenionally unaligned quadword (64 bit word).

Opcodes
-------

   For detailed information on the SH64 machine instruction set, see
`SuperH 64 bit RISC Series Architecture Manual' (SuperH, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH64 opcodes.  In addition, the
following pseudo-opcodes may be expanded into one or more alternate
opcodes:

`movi'
     If the value doesn't fit into a standard `movi' opcode, `as' will
     replace the `movi' with a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcodes.

`pt'
     This expands to a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcode, followed
     by a `ptrel' opcode, or to a `pta' or `ptb' opcode, depending on
     the label referenced.

Options
-------

   The SPARC chip family includes several successive levels, using the
same core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions
at each level.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on
what instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's
architecture reference manual.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (`sparc64-*-*') GAS will not bump
passed sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite'
`-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring an incompatible or higher level.

     `-Av8plus' and `-Av8plusa' select a 32 bit environment.

     `-Av9' and `-Av9a' select a 64 bit environment and are not
     available unless GAS is explicitly configured with 64 bit
     environment support.

     `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a' enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
     UltraSPARC extensions.

`-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa'
     For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av8plus and -Av8plusa, respectively.

`-bump'
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

`-32 | -64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  These options
     are only available with the ELF object file format, and require
     that the necessary BFD support has been included.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Aligned-Data,  Next: Sparc-Float,  Prev: Sparc-Opts,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

Enforcing aligned data
----------------------

   SPARC GAS normally permits data to be misaligned.  For example, it
permits the `.long' pseudo-op to be used on a byte boundary.  However,
the native SunOS and Solaris assemblers issue an error when they see
misaligned data.

   You can use the `--enforce-aligned-data' option to make SPARC GAS
also issue an error about misaligned data, just as the SunOS and Solaris
assemblers do.

   The `--enforce-aligned-data' option is not the default because gcc
issues misaligned data pseudo-ops when it initializes certain packed
data structures (structures defined using the `packed' attribute).  You
may have to assemble with GAS in order to initialize packed data
structures in your own code.

Floating Point
--------------

   The Sparc uses IEEE floating-point numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Directives,  Prev: Sparc-Float,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

Sparc Machine Directives
------------------------

   The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.nword'
     On the Sparc, the `.nword' directive produces native word sized
     value, ie. if assembling with -32 it is equivalent to `.word', if
     assembling with -64 it is equivalent to `.xword'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.register'
     This directive declares use of a global application or system
     register.  It must be followed by a register name %g2, %g3, %g6 or
     %g7, comma and the symbol name for that register.  If symbol name
     is `#scratch', it is a scratch register, if it is `#ignore', it
     just surpresses any errors about using undeclared global register,
     but does not emit any information about it into the object file.
     This can be useful e.g. if you save the register before use and
     restore it after.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

Z8000 Dependent Features
========================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

   The Z8000 has sixteen 16 bit registers, numbered 0 to 15.  You can
refer to different sized groups of registers by register number, with
the prefix `r' for 16 bit registers, `rr' for 32 bit registers and `rq'
for 64 bit registers.  You can also refer to the contents of the first
eight (of the sixteen 16 bit registers) by bytes.  They are named `rNh'
and `rNl'.

Addressing Modes
................

   as understands the following addressing modes for the Z8000:

`rN'
     Register direct

`@rN'
     Indirect register

`ADDR'
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

`address(rN)'
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN is added to the sign
     extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`#XX'
     Immediate data XX.

Assembler Directives for the Z8000
----------------------------------

   The Z8000 port of as includes these additional assembler directives,
for compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  As shown, these do not
begin with `.' (unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
     Generates code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
     Generates code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.
