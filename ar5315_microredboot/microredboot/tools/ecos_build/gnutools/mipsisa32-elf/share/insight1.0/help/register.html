<H1>The Register Window</H1>
<P>The Register Window lists all the registers and their contents for
the selected stack frame. It permits viewing the contents of registers
in different formats, editing register values, and some display
customizations.</P>

<P>The Register Window will update the register contents in the display
to match the stack frame currently being viewed in the <A HREF="source.html">
Source Window</A> and <A HREF="stack.html">Stack Window</A>.</P>
<p>Each time the program stops, the register window will automatically update.
Registers that have changed since the last stop will be displayed in blue.</p>

<H4><A NAME="display_edit">Editing a Register</A> </H4>
<P>
To edit a register, simply click on it with the left mouse button.  Type
in the new value and hit enter.  You can enter a decimal, hex, or float number and
the type will be converted if possible. You may also enter an expression to be evaluated.
For example, to set  $r3 to the same as $r4, edit $r3 and enter "$r4" as the value.  In the same
way, you can set $pc to "main".
The value of the register is set to the current value of the expression; it will not be reevaluated
if the expression's value later changes.
</P>
<P>Press the escape key on the keyboard to cancel your edit.</P>
<H4><A NAME="display_popup">The Register Pop-up Menu</A></H4>
<P>
To activate the pop-up menu, click the right mouse button over a register.
This will allow you change the way the register is displayed, or to remove
it from the display.  Or you can add the register to the watch window.
For integer registers, you can also open a memory window at the
location pointed to by the register.</P>
