Here is a Linux/Cygwin test program for upsd and wme.

Type "make" to build the test programs.

Type "man ./pgen.1" to get a man page with more
details and examples than this README file.
Alternatively, copy pgen.1 to /usr/man/man1 to install the man page.

It is possible to experiment with the program on ethernet.
All you need is two Linux/Cygwin boxes connected by ethernet.

Otherwise one system will be associated to a wireless AP
and the other system will be attached to an ethernet connected
to the AP.

Initial connectivity is tested by running "pgen" on one system
and "pget" on the other.  See the man page for more details.
