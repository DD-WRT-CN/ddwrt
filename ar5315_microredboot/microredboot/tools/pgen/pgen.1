.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pgen
and companion programs may be used to send and receive UDP frames.
They is useful for testing Diffserv queues that use dscp or vlan classification.
It is also useful for generating traffic profiles of various kinds.

The programs are compiled from the same source file, but linked
with different names.  It is a single source file for ease of development.
The code is simple and meant to be easily modified for test generation
and traffic analysis.

The programs send and receive UDP packets on port 12345 which is a compilation
constant.  The programs that send packets (
.B pgen, 
.B phone
) must be given
a destination IP address.  The address can be given 
on the command line either
as a host name (e.g. "pgen test_machine_1") or 
with dot notation (e.g. "phone 192.168.171.22").   

The 
.B pget, ap, and apst
programs do not require an address.
.B Pget
simply logs all packets received on its port.
The
.B ap
program echoes each received packet back to the sender.
.B Apts
is described below.

The default behavior for
.B Pgen 
is to send a packet every 2 seconds to the destination.
The "-period <value>" option can be given on the command line to change
the packet interval to <value> microseconds.  For example,
.br
	"pgen -period 5000"
.br
	"pgen -period 500000"
.br
will send a packet every 5 ms, or 1/sec respectively.

The default diffserv priority sent by pgen is zero (no priority).
If pgen is used with the -wmeload option, the program will cycle
through the list of dscp types compiled into the program.
This version of the program does not contain a mechanism for modifying
the list without editing and compiling the source.

The "-broadcastflag" option causes pgen to send broadcast packets
rather than the normal unicast packets.   The broadcast address
is compiled into the program.

The
.B phone
program sends a 128-byte UDP frame to the destination every <period>
seconds.   The default value for <period> is 10ms, but this can be changed
via the -period option on the command line.  After each packet is sent
the program waits for a response.  The read will time out after 1 sec.
In this version of the program, the timeout value can be changed
by editing the source code.   The program attempts to time the interval
between sending a frame and receiving a response.   The message number
and response time are printed after every exchange.  The expected
output looks like this:


.in +1i
.nf
% phone borg
phone mode
dst: 10.10.10.169
r128 msg(0) delta 	 0:91
r128 msg(1) delta 	 0:9
r128 msg(2) delta 	 0:9
r128 msg(3) delta 	 0:8
r128 msg(4) delta 	 0:18
r128 msg(5) delta 	 0:9
r128 msg(6) delta 	 0:8
r128 msg(7) delta 	 0:13
r128 msg(8) delta 	 0:8
r128 msg(9) delta 	 0:8
r128 msg(10) delta 	 0:19
r128 msg(11) delta 	 0:10
r128 msg(12) delta 	 0:9
r128 msg(13) delta 	 0:8
r128 msg(14) delta 	 0:8
.in -1i
.fi

The received message size is noted by the "r128" and the message
numbers is also indicated.  The time delta is printed to the right.
The notation is seconds:microseconds.   Sometimes it is useful to operate
the phone program at a slower than normal rate, e.g.
	phone -period 500000 192.168.171.99
in order to examine the packets in transit through intermediate equipment.

This version of the program does not include a timestamp in the message.

If the phone program is run with the -hist option,
then it remains silent as messages are received.
Instead the interval time for each message is logged in a histogram
data structure.   The contents of the structure are printed after
every 1000 iterations of the packet exchange loop.
Expected output looks like this:

.in +.2i
.nf
[greg@xtp]$ phone -hist borg
phone mode
dst: 10.10.10.169
avg 63.765999   min(0.000000)   max(8181.000000)
 10     20     30     40     50    100    500   1000   2000   5000      0
  513   384    76     0     0     0    13     4     1     5     4
.fi
.in -.2i

The histogram buckets start at 10us and range to 5ms.   In this example
about half of the 1000 packets were echoed in 10us, and 384 were echoed
in the 10-20us range.
 

The
.B pget
program listens on the port and prints whatever it receives.

The 
.B apts
and
.B staut
programs are derived from
.B ap
and
.B upsd
respectively.
.B Apsd
with no arguments will print a list of available tests meant to coincide
with wifi APSD test procedures, e.g. "B.2".   Operate the program by giving
the name of a test as the (single) argument, e.g. "apts B.2".
The
.B staut
program complements
.B apts
by providing the Station Under Test functionality.
Operate the station program by giving it the ip address of the
.B apts
program, e.g. "staut 192.168.1.10".
The program will send a frame to the apts program which will respond with
a frame that selects the test behavior at the station.
Unlike the other programs
.B upsd
or
.B phone,
statistics gathering and timing information is meant to be collected
by a passive sniffer application.


.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Missing arguments and some errors are diagnosed.
.SH NOTES
It is not possible to operate pgen and pget simultaneously on the same system
because they bind to the same port.

This is an engineering test program, not a "product".
Don't expect too much.
.SH BUGS
There are several optional behaviors and flags not described on this man page.
If you have this man page, you also have the source code (hint).

The delta time reporting needs to be calibrated
and amended with a method uses round-trip timestamps.
This version of the program doesn't generate or record vlan tags.

The program should figure out the broadcast IP address instead
of using a compiled-in value although this is not an important feature
of the program and probably could be removed.

The raw socket interface may not exist or may require additional code
on some platforms.
