Here is a Linux test program for upsd and wme.

Type "make" to build the test programs.

Type "man ./pgen.1" to get a man page.
Or copy pgen.1 to /usr/man/man1 to install the man page.

It is possible to experiment with the program on ethernet.
All you need is two Linux boxes connected by ethernet.

For exercising upsd, have a wireless Linux box run the "phone"
program.   Have an ethernet Linux box on the ethernet side
of the AP running the "ap" program.
