nothing much to say here. take care about the assembly headers. do not use procedurable functions in it, use macros instead
reason is the way we link the binary. its linked to run from the ram address 0x80400000 but start from flash address 0xbfc00000
the code will be relocated to the ram address right after the dram and cpu was initialized.

so we can not use direct jumps or calls, only relative references within these assembly stubs are possible.
