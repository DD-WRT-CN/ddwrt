2004-10-04  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ftpclient.c (opendatasock): Don't clobber the socket
	variable with a temporary variable of local scope.

2004-05-24  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/ftpclient.c: 
	* include/ftpclient.h:
	* cdl/ftpclient.cdl: Add new functions 'ftp_get_var()' and 'ftp_put_var()'
	which allow for streams of data instead of fixed buffers.

2003-07-02  Daniel Néri  <daniel.neri@sigicom.se>

	* src/ftpclient.c (send_cmd): Fix typo in error message.
	(opendatasock): Use snprintf instead of sprintf.

2003-04-28  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ftpclient.c (connect_to_server): Added support for
	IPv6. This meant changing from using the PORT command to using
	EPRT, when setting up the data connection. EPRT is protocol 
	independant. 
	* tests/ftpclient1.c (ftp_test): Added tests which use IPv6
	addresses. Fixed a few minor bugs with format strings.
	* doc/ftpclient.sgml: Mention we support IPv6 and DNS.

	* cdl/ftpclient.cdl: Add doc link.

2002-08-06  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ftpclient.c: Send "quit" not "quit " to keep some servers
	  happy.  Also deal with multi line replies correctly.
	
2002-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/ftpclient.sgml: New file.  Document it.

2001-12-04  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ftpclient.c: Allow it to compile!

2001-11-04  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
