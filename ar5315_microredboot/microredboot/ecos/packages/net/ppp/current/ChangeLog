	* windows_telnet.c: now demonstrates chat script TIMEOUT, which
	makes connection more snappy. It also repeatably attempts at
	connect until a connection is established instead of a single try.
	Once a telnet session is aborted, a new one can be established.
	Also cleaned up the indentation to make it more readable.

2004-06-24  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* tests/windows_telnet.c:
	* cdl/ppp.cdl:

	* src/ppp_io.c: 
	* src/sys-ecos.c: 	
	* src/ppp_io.h:	
	The wait_input function sometimes blocked even if a packet was
	available for processing. Now checks the tty queue and then the 
	serial driver before blocking.

2004-05-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/auth.c: Don't use non-eCos <paths.h>
	* src/pppd.c: Don't use non-eCos <sys/wait.h> and <sys/resource.h>
	* src/sys-ecos.c: netmask must be extern - not all tools have
	COMMON section support.

2004-04-15  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* src/chat.c: Script now returns success when it runs to completion

2004-03-31  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Correct capitalisation in display strings.

2004-03-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	which syslog() messages actually get printed.

	* include/ppp.h: Widen kdebugflag option to 5 bits.

	* src/ppp_io.c: Converted some db_printf() calls to diag_printf().

	* src/sys-ecos.c: Delay return of cyg_ppp_wait_up() until IP
	addresses have been set. Add ifdef for CYGPKG_PPP_DEBUG_WARN_ONLY
	to syslog().

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Added documentation of CYGPKG_PPP_DEBUG_WARN_ONLY
	option. Improved documentation of kdebugflag runtime option.

2004-01-09  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Fix typographical error.

2004-01-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* tests/test_server.sh: Added a dbecho of the PPPD command line.

2003-12-23  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Added A&M Adder boards to list of those that
	support hardware flow control.

2003-12-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/pppd.c (vfmtmsg): Disabled PowerPC-specific ifndef, we don't
	have the differences in va_list that this is coping with.

2003-11-12  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Addition comments concerning serial flow control from
	Nick Garnett.

2003-10-10  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Fix documentation build error.

2003-09-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/magic.c (magic_init): Added pseudo-pid to seed
	initialization to add some variety.

	* include/pppd.h: 
	* include/names.h: 
	* src/pppd.c: Added flowctl global variable to control flow
	control of serial line. Removed crtscts variable.

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Fixed enable of CHAP support, it was zero.

	* src/ppp_io.h:
	* src/ppp_io.c:
	* src/sys-ecos.c (set_up_tty): Added switch to set flow control of
	serial line depending on flowctl variable. Added ifdefs around use
	of line status callbacks -- not all drivers support them.
	
	* include/ppp.h: Added flowctl field to cyg_ppp_options_t
	structure plus a set of defines for its possible values.

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Added documentation of flowctl field.

	* tests/test_server.sh:
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c:
	* tests/tcp_echo.c:
	Added ability to use software flow control in these tests and an
	option on test_server commandline to select it for the host.
	
2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* tests/test_server.sh: Changed to /bin/bash on first line, just
	in case. Added "nodetach" option to pppd. It seems that some
	versions of pppd fork into the background by default, and some,
	like the one I tested all this with initially, do not. This option
	should make them all behave the same.

2003-07-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/magic.c (magic): Removed use of getpid(), since this is the
	only dependency here on the POSIX library.

2003-07-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Updated configuration section to mention
	requirement for net and serial packages. Various other fixes.

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Added requirements for CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL and
	CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_DEVICES. Various other tidies.

	* src/sys-ecos.c: Added dummy versions of various PAP and CHAP
	functions to satisfy references in auth.c when PAP and CHAP have
	been configured out.

	* tests/test_server.sh: Added some comments and tidied a little.
	
2003-07-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Added CYGPKG_PPP_TESTS_ALL to control which tests
	get made. Changed default value of CYGPKG_PPP_TESTS_AUTOMATE to
	build automated tests by default.

	* tests/ppp_updown.c: Changed ping timeout to seven seconds. The
	larger packets can take a long time to exchange at the lower baud
	rates.
	
	* doc/ppp.sgml: Updated to reflect latest changes.

2003-07-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Added CYGPKG_PPP_TESTS_AUTOMATE and
	CYGDAT_PPP_TEST_BAUD_RATES options.
	
	* src/sys-ecos.c: Close sockfd correctly.

	* src/chat.c: Some small fixes to make system re-entrant. Fixed
	success flag to comply with documentation.
	
	* tests/ppp_test_support.inl: File added to contain the common
	parts for all PPP tests. This mostly involves the sending of
	commands to the test_server.sh script.

	* tests/test_server.sh: Modified to respond to baud rate change
	commands and to loop until a finish command is added. Added
	various extra tests for authentication and chat testing.


	* tests/ppp_auth.c: Test added to test PAP and CHAP
	authentication.

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Updated to reflect latest test changes.
	
	* tests/ppp_up.c: 
	* tests/ppp_updown.c: 
	* tests/chat.c: 
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c: 
	* tests/tcp_echo.c:
	Tests converted to use ppp_test_support.inl and to run multiple
	tests in some instances.

2003-07-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/ppp_io.c (pppasyncstart): Removed a couple of spurious
	breaks. These were causing the TX thread to loop unnecessarily,
	and also seemed to cause some occasional packet corruptions.

	* tests/ppp_up.c: Fixed loop to be more responsive to the PPP link
	going down.
	
2003-07-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/ppp.sgml: Added further documentation on testing.

	* tests/test_server.sh: Various fixes.

2003-06-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Added CYGPKG_PPP_TEST_DEVICE to specify device used
	by test programs.
	Added requirement for CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_FLOW_CONTROL. 
	
	* doc/ppp.sgml: Added descriptions of test programs. Various
	tidies and fixes.

	* src/chat.c: Added some local debug support.
	
	* tests/ppp_up.c:
	* tests/ppp_updown.c:
	* tests/chat.c:
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c:
	* tests/tcp_echo.c:
	Added chat script (or modified existing one) to announce the name
	of the test over the serial line. This is to interface to the
	test_server.sh script. Use CYGPKG_PPP_TEST_DEVICE. ppp_updown now
	interrogates the ppp0 interface for the remote end's IP
	address. chat now switches to 115200 baud.

	* tests/isp.c: Use CYGPKG_PPP_TEST_DEVICE.

	* tests/test_server.sh: Shell script to act as a remote end for
	PPP testing. Each test announces itself over the link and this
	script executes the correct set of commands to run the test.
	
2003-06-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Removed CYGNUM_PPP_THREAD_COUNT. Updated
	descriptions of other options.

	* src/chat.c:
	* src/sys-ecos.c:
	* include/ppp.h: Some minor tidying, and API semantic changes
	mostly prompted by trying to document the API and discovering some
	inconsistencies.

	* tests/ppp_up.c: Modified in line with API semantic changes.
	
	* doc/ppp.sgml:
	* doc/makefile:
	* doc/ppp_sa.sgml:
	Added documentation. The actual documentation is in ppp.sgml. The
	makefile and ppp_sa.sgml allow a stand-alone copy of the
	documentation to be generated.

2003-06-17  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/ppp.h: Removed some unused options from
	cyg_ppp_options_t.

	* src/ipcp.c:
	* src/lcp.c:
	* src/ppp_io.c:
	* src/pppd.c:
	* src/sys-ecos.c:
	Removed some defunct BSD code, tidied up a little.

	* src/chat.c: Some tidying.
	
	* cdl/ppp.cdl:
	* tests/nc_test_slave.c:
	* tests/nc_test_framework.h:
	Added nc_test_slave test.

	* tests/ppp_up.c: Changed wait to print out TCP/IP tables every
	minute.

	* tests/tcp_echo.c: Tidied up a little.
	
2003-06-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/ppp.cdl: Added dialup number, control over compression, and
	some extra tests.

	* include/pppd.h: Changed inspeed to be a cyg_serial_baud_rate_t
	enum.

	* include/ppp.h: Added default_route, modem, baud and script
	options to cyg_ppp_options_t.

	* include/names.h: Header added to redefine all external names in
	the PPP package so that they do not pollute to application's
	namespace.
	
	* src/chat.c:
	* include/syslog.h:
	* include/ppp_io.h: Tidied and commented.


	* src/if_ppp.c: Added include of pkgconf/ppp.h.

	* src/ppp_io.c: Expunged some unnecessary BSD code, various tides.
	
	* src/pppd.c: Added handling of CHAT scripting during bring-up,
	carrier detect and proper shutdown.
	Expunged some unnecessary BSD code, various tides.
	
	* src/sys-ecos.c: Improved startup and shutdown synchronization,
	added carrier detect handling.
	Expunged some unnecessary BSD code, various tides.

	* tests/isp.c:
	* tests/ppp_up.c:
	* tests/ppp_updown.c:
	Generally tidied and cleaned up a bit. Added ping functionality to
	some tests to check routing.
	
	* tests/tcp_echo.c:
	New test, an adaptation of the standard tcp_echo net test that
	brings the PPP link up before starting the test.
	
	* include/zlib.h:
	* src/bsd_comp.c:
	* src/ppp_deflate.c:
	* src/zlib.c:
	Added these files to implement PPP compression. However at present
	there seem to be problems with this code, so compression is
	disabled by default. In any case, these algorithms need enormous
	amounts of working memory, so may not be useful in an embedded
	system.

	Initial checkin of PPP code -- mainly as a safety/backup
	measure. There is still a good deal of tidying up to be done
	here. At present there is a lot of ifdeffed out BSD code present,
	which is there as a reminder of what should be done in the eCos
	code. The tests are incomplete, and there is no documentation.
