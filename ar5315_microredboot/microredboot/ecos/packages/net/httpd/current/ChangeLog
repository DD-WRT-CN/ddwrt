2004-10-05  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/monitor.c: include sys/sysctl.h to prevent compiler
	warnings.

2004-08-16  Peter Korsgaard <jacmet@sunsite.dk>

	* src/monitor.c: Added missing spaces in multi-line HTML strings.

2004-03-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* include/httpd.h: 
	* src/init.cxx: 
	* src/httpd.c: 
	* src/init.cxx:
	* doc/httpd.sgml:
	Added option to enable auto-starting of HTTPD. This is set by
	default so the current behaviour is retained. When this is
	disabled the application has to call cyg_httpd_startup() to get
	the server going.

2004-02-23  Jeff Duncan  <jeffd@magtek.com>

	* src/httpd.c (cyg_httpd_server): Fix http header by adding
          newline after server name.

2003-10-21  Eric Doenges <Eric.Doenges@DynaPel.com>

	* src/monitor.c (cyg_monitor_memory): Check if the request
	contains a 'base' parameter and don't display anything if it does
	not. This prevents the monitor from attempting to access memory
	location '0' when the user accesses the memory html page for the
	first time without any parameters.

2003-09-23  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

        * src/httpd.c (cyg_httpd_server): Removed unused variable.

        cyg_httpd_send_data to match implementation.

2003-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>
