	* cdl/hal_openrisc_orp.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.

	* cdl/hal_openrisc_orp.cdl: CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR need only be a
	bool.
	CYGSEM_HAL_ROM_MONITOR should be default off (should be used later...)
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_openrisc_orp_ram.ldi: Add sections as per
	changes to arch HAL's openrisc.ld.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_openrisc_orp_rom.ldi: Ditto.
