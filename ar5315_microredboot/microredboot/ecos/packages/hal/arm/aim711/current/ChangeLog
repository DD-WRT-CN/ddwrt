        * src/aim711_misc.c: 
        The I2C transfer routine waits now while the bus is busy
        instead of just return an error.

	* include/plf_aux.h:
	* include/plf_io.h:

        in plf_io.h.

        * cdl/hal_arm_aim711.cdl: Fixed typos.

2003-10-02  Roland Cassebohm <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

	* cdl/hal_arm_aim711.cdl:
        Implement CYGINT_HAL_ARM_BIGENDIAN.
        Use "-mno-short-load-words" in compiler flags to avoid unaligned
        access, which would cause exceptions.

	* include/hal_cache.h:
	* include/hal_diag.h: 

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h: Set HAL_PLATFORM_RESET() to
        hal_reset().

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Changed for direct initial 
	SDRAM setup. External IO is maped to 0x3fd0000. Changed LED macros
	to use only the first three bits of PIO.

	* include/plf_io.h:

	* include/plf_stub.h: Remove HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_RESET defines,
        because they are not used anymore.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_aim711_ram.h: Moved FLASH to 0x2000000 
	and changed the size to 0x200000. Changed size of RAM to 0x800000.
        RedBoot is used as main bootloader. To be sure there is enough
        space in future, the RAM version resevers RAM up to 0x30000.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_aim711_ram.ldi: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_aim711_rom.h: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_aim711_rom.ldi: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_aim711_romram.h: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_aim711_romram.ldi: Same.

	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm:
	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm:
	* misc/redboot_ROMRAM.ecm:

	* src/hal_diag.c: Implement hal_diag_led() for the diagnostic board
        of the AIM.

	* src/aim711_misc.c:
        Implemented reset functionality of the AIM 711 board.

	New package for the ARM Industrial Module AIM 711 cloned from
