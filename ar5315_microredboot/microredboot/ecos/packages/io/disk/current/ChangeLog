 	* src/disk.c:
 	* include/disk.h:
 	* include/diskio.h:
 	Use predefined arrays for partition devices and info 
 	radher than malloc. Extended DISK_CHANNEL macro to
  	support defining maximum number of partitions.

	* src/disk.c:
	* include/disk.h: Removed block_pos arguments from
	hardware driver read and write calls: it is not necessary.

	* src/disk.c (read_mbr): Modified to read a complete sector from
	the disk rather than pieces. Drivers should only ever see
	reads/writes in multiples of 512 bytes.

2003-10-16 Savin Zlobec <savin@elatec.si>

	* src/disk.c:
        Check return code from MBR scan and set
        connected flag only if there was no error.
