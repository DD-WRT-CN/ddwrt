	* src/if_lancepci.c: Fix builing with lwip.

2004-03-02  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

        * src/if_lancepci.c: Added casts to fix various compiler warnings.

2004-02-27  Iztok Zupet  <iz@elsis.si>

        * if_lancepci.c: fetch ESA from chips registers instead
          EEPROM. There seems to be no usable data in the VMware EEPROM
          emulation. But the data which comes in CSR_PAR registers seems
          OK.

        * if_lancepci.c: added aditional delay (printf) to init
          function, to fix it under Vmware 4.

        * if_lancepci.c: fixed buffer reset after start,
          added additional delays (50ms)after start and control
          function, to let Vmware get a tick so that it can
          service the virtual chip. Added an interrupt controled
          transmit busy flag (cpd->txbusyh), so that the stop/start
          function can wait for it, thus not stopping the chip 
          aburptly.

        * amd_lance.h: additional items in cpd data structure.

        * all: Cloned from PCnet original
