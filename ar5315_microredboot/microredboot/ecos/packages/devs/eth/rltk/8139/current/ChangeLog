	* src/if_8139.c (rltk8139_recv): if eth_drv_recv() wants to
	discard an incoming packet it sets the buffer address == 0. Add a
	check for this and skip the memcpy if found.

	* src/if_8139.c:
	add known device 0x11db/0x1234 from Dreamcast Broadband Adapter.
	add Platform depend Initialize entry.

	* src/if_8139.c: Use cyg_drv_isr_lock/unlock functions for ISR
	critical sections - much better than calling cyg_interrupt_enable
	directly.

	* src/if_8139.c:
