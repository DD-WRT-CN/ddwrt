	* src/if_dp83816.c: Enable start/stop functions (device was always
	enabled once configured before)

2003-10-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/if_dp83816.c (dp83816_poll): Try to better detect condition
	where device just stops.  This seems to be related to Rx overruns,
	but there is no status reported.  The best that can be done is
	detect the condition and then reset/restart the device.

	* src/dp83816.h: Let default ESA be a pointer, so platforms can more
	easily set it a runtime.

	* src/if_dp83816.c: 
	* src/dp83816.h: 
	* cdl/ns_dp83816_eth_drivers.cdl: New package - ethernet driver for
	National Semiconductor DP83816 PCI
