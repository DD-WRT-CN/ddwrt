This sourcecode is the smallest every builded redboot (less than 64 kb). it uses a decompression stub to load a lzma compressed redboot image
into ram. the device initialisation itself is done within the stub itself. you can find the stub source within the ./boot dir
if you build it manually, take care about the RESETBUTTON environment variable. it defines the gpio configuration for the reset button.
the lower 4 bits are for the gpio itself and the higher 4 bits are for the type (1 means inverted, 0 means normal)
for senao devices that means 0x15 (inverted gpio 5)

this reset button is used to trigger the recovery redboot.
so the stub will boot up linux directly if this button is not pressed. this will decrease the bootup time alot.
if the button is pushed, the redboot will be started and can be used like known from the past.
if the reset button is pushed longer than 5 seconds, the dd-wrt nvram config will be resetted
if you keep it pushed a little bit longer, redboot will start a recovery tftp which accepts external firmware uploads.
supported are DD-WRT webflash,Ubiquiti,Wiligear and Senao images
simply send it with tftp -i 192.168.1.1 put newfirmware.bin to the device (ip might be different, depending from the device)


the build_targets.sh script will build all available memory, flash, ethernet phy and reset button configurations
for building the source you need the ecos mips toolchain (included ./tools dir) and any dd-wrt mips big endian toolchain (see dd-wrt download directory, you will find it if you seek for it)
